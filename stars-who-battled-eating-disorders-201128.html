She told Us Weekly exclusively in June 2021 that <a href=#>her habits were “obsessive and unhealthy”</a> — but she didn’t realize it right away.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Honestly, it was a really long up and down journey of understanding food and understanding how I saw food and how my body received food,” the Dancing With the Stars alum explained at the time. “There was a lot of learning and a lot of patience and grace involved. … Now I don’t count or track calories. I’m just kind of eating clean, because I also know that food is a fuel and for what I do and it is important to eat healthy.”</p><p>Scroll down to which celebs have bravely overcome their struggles.</p><p>If you or someone you know struggles with an eating disorder, visit the <a href=#>National Association of Anorexia Nervosa & Associated Disorders (ANAD) website</a> or call their hotline at (888)-375-7767 to get help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKCfYq%2BiwNOlnJ1llZbBqrrGZpuiq5%2Bnsaa%2B0mZpaWlhZ4VwfZVtaXBlYmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./survivor-recap-season-46-episode-12-mamma-bear-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Survivor Recap: Ave Maria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./should-you-get-the-field-notes-slow-and-slower-community-day-special-research-in-pokemon-go.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Should you get the Field Notes: Slow and Slower Community Day Special Research in Pokmon Go?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
