Also, the two beings that Arceus makes are <a href=# title="Dialga (Pokémon)">Dialga</a> and <a href=# title="Palkia (Pokémon)">Palkia</a>, creators of time and space, respectively.

Apparently, there was one more Pokémon that appeared at the same time. A Pokémon with as much power as Dialga and Palkia... But also one whose name was never to be spoken--<a href=# title="Giratina (Pokémon)">Giratina</a>! It's said to lurk in another world... A world on the opposite side of ours...<p><b>At the <a href=# title="Distortion World">Distortion World</a>:</b></p><i>The legend of Giratina has been all but forgotten but to a few...</i> <i>The legend told of a world on the other side of ours. This world.</i> <i>Why does this world exist? Why is Giratina here all alone?</i><p>This myth is not in the Canalave Library, but rather are <a href=# title=Cynthia>Cynthia</a>'s conclusions of her studies about the ancient myths.</p><p>When the player visits the cave painting of Celestic Town after entering the <a href=# title="Hall of Fame">Hall of Fame</a> in <a href=# title="Pokémon Platinum Version">Pokémon Platinum</a>, Cynthia will join them and discuss her interpretation of the painting.</p>This cave painting... It's always been described this way. The light in the center represents either <a href=# title="Dialga (Pokémon)">Dialga</a> or <a href=# title="Palkia (Pokémon)">Palkia</a> appearing at the Spear Pillar. The three lights around it were thought to be <a href=# title="Uxie (Pokémon)">Uxie</a>, <a href=# title="Mesprit (Pokémon)">Mesprit</a>, and <a href=# title="Azelf (Pokémon)">Azelf</a>. But, then, I realized that there may be another way of interpreting this. Could this triangle of lights actually represent a different trio? Could they be Dialga, Palkia, and <a href=# title="Giratina (Pokémon)">Giratina</a> instead? And the large light in the center. Does it represent something else? Could it be what created this world of ours? Do you know of the ancient <a href=# title=Plate>Plates</a> they find all over Sinnoh? One of them had this engraved on it. "Two beings of time and space set free from the <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Original One</a>." I think this quote, too, points to the presence of another Pokémon. A Pokémon even more powerful than Dialga or Palkia. Does that sound plausible to you? I'm not quite sure how Giratina fits into this scheme of things, but... It's said that in the <a href=# title="Distortion World">Distortion World</a>, neither time nor space were stable. I think that tells us something about Giratina, the only Pokémon there. It must have been as powerful as Dialga and Palkia, the rulers of time and space. In some way, though, Giratina has to have a power opposite of theirs. A long time ago, I wonder what sort of person painted this? Dialga's <a href=# title="Roar of Time (move)">Roar of Time</a>... Palkia's <a href=# title="Spacial Rend (move)">Spacial Rend</a>... To the people back then, those Pokémon really must have appeared to rule over time and space. Seeing them must have shaken the people to their very core. This painting represents those feelings of awe, wonder, and everything else. It passed that memory to countless people, eventually becoming a myth... That's what I believe as a researcher of myths. I think I let myself get carried away and talked for far too long. I'm sorry, and thank you. Let's meet again.<p>If the player has acquired Arceus in Pokémon Platinum, a <a href=# title="Hiker (Trainer class)">Hiker</a> appears in Oreburgh Mine and then again in Canalave's library to relate the following myth.</p><p><b>At <a href=# title="Oreburgh Mine">Oreburgh Mine</a>:</b></p>If I had to explain very simply, I study how people came to be. That could explain why I happen to be in Sinnoh. In Sinnoh, there is a myth on how the world came into existence. Investigating that myth may give me insight on the emergence of people. I found something very interesting soon after arrival. You may have it, if you'd like." <i>The Hiker gives the player a <a href=# title="Flame Plate">Flame Plate</a>.</i> I'm told that Plate was created at the same time as Sinnoh. The plate I found bears this inscription. "The rightful bearer of a Plate draws from the Plate it holds" The rightful bearer, I think, may point to the shaper of this world. Oh, by the way, I'm only interested in the words and thoughts left behind. Physical artifacts like that Plate don't interest me once I've read them. I hope we meet again somewhere.<p><b>At <a href=# title="Canalave City">Canalave City</a>:</b></p>Well, hello! We meet again! After we parted, I went from <a href=# title="Oreburgh City">Oreburgh</a>, to <a href=# title="Hearthome City">Hearthome</a>, <a href=# title="Celestic Town">Celestic</a>, then <a href=# title="Eterna City">Eterna</a>. Yes, the town and cities surrounding the foot of Mt. Coronet. Why the fascination with Mt. Coronet, you may ask? Well Mt. Coronet happens to be called "The origin of Sinnoh." I learned many things on my journey. Would you like to hear them? The way I see it, our world began when the spirit within people was born. When that spirit came to be, there followed awareness about the world. Within the newborn spirit, time and space were intertwined as one. People and Pokémon, too, were but the same presence. As I understand it, people and Pokémon shared the spirit and awareness. They should have understood and accepted each other then. Because they shared the same spirit, people and Pokémon intermingled. People took the place of Pokémon, and the opposite also held true. That interpretation could give us an idea about how our world came to be. A Pokémon is said to have shaped this world. Could that Pokémon be the physical form of the original spirit? Hmm... The spirit came to be, and from it, time and space were born... That seems to point to Legendary Dialga, the Pokémon of time, and Palkia, the Pokémon of space... And they lead back to Arceus, the Pokémon that made them arise. Oh, there were also Plates, weren't there? One Plate read "Three beings were born to bind time and space." Those three beings I read to mean the three Pokémon of the lakes. It's about Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. The myth describes how they gave spirit to the world, shaping it. But it all starts with Arceus, the first. It is known as the Original One. Oh, by the way, I wrote down the words engraved on those Plates. I summarized them in a book and donated it to this library, There it is in that bookshelf. I'd be pleased if you'd read it. I have to say, I'm glad I came out to Sinnoh. I suppose I'd better be off in search of new myths in faraway lands. It would be nice if our paths were to cross again.<p><b>"Sinnoh's Beginning as Told on Plates."</b></p>This is a collection of engravings from ancient Plates found in Sinnoh. "The Original One breathed alone before the universe came." "When the universe was created, its shards became this Plate." "The power of defeated giants infuses this Plate."
