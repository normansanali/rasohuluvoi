He has been playing Point Guard at Sierra Canyon School, and in 2023, he confirmed that he would be heading to the University of Southern California to continue to play basketball.

Savannah James shared photos of her son looking incredibly handsome and grown up, which she captioned with "Prom 2023. Lost for words on this one."</p><p>LeBron James was also proud of this moment and shared his own photos of his son on social media. In the caption, he wrote, "TOUGH.

His date, Gelfuso, is reported to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have worn a black strapless dress</a> (although she did not appear in photos posted on either Savannah or LeBron's social media). But what should have been a beautiful moment was met with unfair criticism.</p><p>Fox News notes that a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo taken from the night received criticism</a>. The publication wrote: "The USC commit's photos were plastered across Instagram over the course of the week, and some appeared to be upset with James taking Gelfuso to the prom because she is White."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LeBron-James-Cant-Keep-A-Straight-Face-During-National-Anthem-Rendition.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Attending their second event together increased the attention on Bronny and Peyton's relationship.

She is also much more active on social media than Bronny and currently has tens of thousands of followers on Instagram. But, if we needed a clue as to what was happening with them, Bronny did comment on Peyton's photos. This includes comments like "why u so cute doe," "perf fr;" and "thas cute." Is this definitive proof that they are more than friends? Absolutely not, but it offers a glimpse into their platonic or romantic relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How LeBron James' Wife Has Supported His Career</a></span></p><p>If you are curious about who Peyton Gelfuso is (apart from being stunning and sharing a glimpse into her glamorous world and great style), you may have to wait until she or Bronny James decides to share an update.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peyton.jpg><p>For now, we can focus on the basketball player's exciting future ahead of him.

"I need to be on the floor with my boy, I got to be on the floor with Bronny," he said (via ESPN). "Either in the same uniform or a matchup against him... But I would love to do the whole Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. thing. That would be ideal, for sure. I ask him what are his aspirations, and he says he wants to play in the NBA. So, if he wants do to it, he's got to put in the work. I'm here already, so I'm just waiting on him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnpqipLtutsCmnKxlo6S7bq7RqKWnsV2lv7C5jJ2YrZ1dpbK6wM6nZKCdnJvCtLuMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lopawqr%2FMaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luka-modric.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Luka Modric - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khalil-macks-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khalil Mack's Wife: Relationships, Girlfriends [2023 Update]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
