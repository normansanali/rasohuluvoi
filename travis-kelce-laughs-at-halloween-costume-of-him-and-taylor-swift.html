Jax’s fiancé, <strong>Braverijah Greg</strong>, dressed in a Swift, 33, costume — including a blonde wig — and then placed Swift’s face on Jax dressed as a map.</p><p>“Oh my f—king gosh. Oh my f—king goodness,” Travis laughed on a Wednesday, November 1, podcast episode of “<a href=# rel=noopener>New Heights</a>,” which he cohosts with brother <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, who cracked up in the background. “She put me on the map, right there in the video.”</p><p>“That’s so good, man,” Travis continued with a smile on his face. “God damn, that was golden. Hats off. That was well done. You get a round of applause for that one, I enjoyed that.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Travis — who is known for being one of the <a href=#>best players in the NFL</a> — has laughed at the phrase.</p><p>Earlier this month, a fan handed him <a href=#>a friendship bracelet</a> with “On the Map” spelled out on it during a Philadelphia Eagles vs. New York Jets game. At the time, he giggled and gave the fan a fist bump from afar.</p><p>Elsewhere in the podcast episode, Travis — who plays as a tight end for the Chiefs — declared this year “Kelce Halloween” while reacting to a family that dressed up as him, Jason <a href=#>and their mom</a>. In the photo, the mom rocked a split jersey featuring both of the athlete’s numbers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Laughs-at-Fans-Dressing-Up-as-Him-and-Taylor-Swift-for-Halloween-That-Was-Golden.png><p>Another fan used an audio clip from “New Heights” while dressing up as the brothers. In the TikTok, the social media users mouthed over a conversation between Jason and Travis from when the Philadelphia Eagles player mentioned that wife <a href=#><strong>Kylie Kelce</strong> </a>was late to deliver his jeans.</p><p>Travis and Swift, 33, were first linked when he revealed he<a href=#> tried to ask her out</a> in July after attending <a href=#>an Eras Tour show</a> in Kansas City.</p><p>Swift later supported him at multiple Chiefs games in September and October and even sat beside his parents and brought famous friends including <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a> and more.</p><p>On Monday, October 30, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that<a href=#> Swift flew to Kansas City</a> “to comfort and encourage [Travis] in any way she could” after the Chiefs lost to the Denver Broncos.</p><p>According to the insider, the duo was planning “to <a href=#>celebrate Halloween together</a>” by attending a few parties.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before Swift jets off to continue the second leg of her Eras Tour, a separate source told Us, “[Travis is] going to see her <a href=#>when she’s back on tour</a>. That’s already planned.” they continued, “And when she gets a break, she’ll see him. It’s going so well because it’s easy and nothing is complicated.”</p><p>Swift returns to tour on Thursday, November 9, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She then travels to countries including Brazil, Japan, Australia, England, Germany and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1doa62s8esZJqsXZ2urbjOsJyepl2YvLTA1KacZqeWYrWquYyapZ1lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./officials-two-children-struck-killed-by-amtrak-train-in-chester-pa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Two children struck, killed by Amtrak train in Chester, PA</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-top-10-nfl-safetys-of-all-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Top 10 NFL Safeties of All Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
