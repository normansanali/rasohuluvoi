The Prestel family is now grappling with the heartbreaking loss of their daughter.</p><p>Icelee Elaine Prestel, of Moore, Oklahoma, passed from this life on October 16, 2023, at the age of 14. She was born January 31, 2009, in Siloam Springs, Arkansas.</p><p>The incident unfolded around 9 p.m. as the Amtrak Heartland Flyer train was making its way northbound from Fort Worth to Oklahoma City. At the time of the collision, there were 91 passengers on board, all of whom remained unharmed. One passenger aboard the train described the harrowing moment when the train came to an abrupt halt, and the passengers began to notice an unusual odor in the cabins.</p><p>Mark Sexton, the executive director of Oklahoma Operation Lifesaver, a railroad safety education organization, explained the challenges of stopping a train of this magnitude. He emphasized that a freight train traveling at 55 mph would require nearly a mile to come to a complete stop. The helplessness of those on board in avoiding such collisions is deeply distressing.</p><p>In response to the incident, the Moore Police Department brought in mental health professionals and therapy dogs to offer support to the affected passengers, train staff, and family members.</p><p>Icelee Prestel was a student at Central Junior High in Moore, and Moore Public Schools has announced that members of their mental health team will be on hand to assist both staff and students in dealing with this tragic loss.</p><p>In memory of Icelee, her family is planning a balloon release event at Buck Thomas Park on Sunday at 2 p.m.</p><p>Danya Myers took facebook and wrote,</p><p>“As everyone has heard by now, Icelee Prestel was struck by at train and passed away on October 16. Right now I’m asking for peace as our family goes through this.”</p><p>Kenneth Myers also shared Icelee Prestel’s death news on social media by stating,</p><p>“Please pray for me and my family as we lost our daughter Icelee Prestel passed away last night we are devastated RIP Icelee mom and dad love you with all our heart and you will greatly missed.”</p><p>The entire Moore community is mourning the loss of this young junior high student, and this tragic incident serves as a reminder of the importance of safety around railroad tracks and crossings.</p><h2>Icelee Prestel Obituary</h2><p>According to local law enforcement, the eighth-grader was attempting to cross the train tracks along Southeast 4th Street and Santa Fe Avenue when the incident took place. Tragically, she did not make it safely across the tracks.</p><p>Icelee attended Calvary Freewill Baptist Church in Norman. When she was younger, she was involved in the AWANAS at church. Icelee loved to cook and was known for her rice, ramen, and mozzarella sticks. She loved egg nog and any kind of cereal. Icelee loved skateboarding at Buck Thomas Park. She loved to walk and enjoyed going on walks. Icelee loved hanging out with her friends. She enjoyed swimming and playing Mine Craft. Icelee was very close to her sisters, Summer and Baelea and loved doing her make-up with them.</p><p>She was notorious for hanging out in Summer’s room just talking and would always fall asleep in her bed. Icelee attended Central Junior High School in Moore and was in the 8th grade. She was involved in choir and the Native Club, which was a Native American Heritage Club for students. Icelee was looking forward to joining the wrestling team. She will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved her.</p><p>Icelee is survived by her mom, Danya Prestel and dad, Kenny Myers, of the home in Moore; her father, Anthony Prestel, of Watts, Oklahoma; 2 sisters, Summer and Baelea, of the home in Moore; “Grammy,” Teri Benson, of Eufaula, Oklahoma; “PaPa & Nana,” Jim & Glenda Kirk, of Rogers, Arkansas; “Memaw & Papa, Debbie & Kenneth Myers, Sr., of Harrah, Oklahoma; “Grandma,” Virginia Naney, of Mt.
