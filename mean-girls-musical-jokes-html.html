How many classic lines will the musical retain? What changes will the audience tolerate, let alone enjoy? What tweaks will give the musical its own life, rather than just re-create the movie at twice the run time? And most importantly, just how dumb will Karen be? Don’t worry. Karen is as clueless as ever, and a majority of the movie’s classic lines remain fetch. Other jokes, however, have been updated, blown out, or simply switched up for a little something new. Fresh off their nominations for <a href=#>Best Musical, Best Book for a Musical, and many more</a>, here is a very subjective list of all the best new jokes in the Mean Girls musical.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhkz4yq1001m3d60qekztbqz@published data-word-count=19><strong>Cady, when told her family would be leaving Kenya for Chicago:</strong><br>“America?
