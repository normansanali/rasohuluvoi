Name any other mother from a reality television franchise who has co-opted Halloween and renamed it after her own child? We’ll wait. It’s no secret that throughout all the ups and downs of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>drama portrayed</a> on the Bravo show, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>, Kyle is one loving, doting mom to her four beautiful daughters. And honestly, we love to see it!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kyle’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>girls</a> are the proud products of two marriages. Kyle&nbsp;began her career as a child star in the 1970s and 80s, appearing in television shows like&nbsp;Little House on the Prairie and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>classic slasher films like&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Halloween</a>,&nbsp;opposite <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a>. She appeared in various other shows and movies throughout the 2000s while also concentrating on raising her girls, before relaunching her career in 2010 as one of the most iconic Housewives to date. But even with the massive success she’s experienced in reality television, anyone who knows Kyle or watches her on RHOBH, knows just how much this woman is devoted to her family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On July 3, reports surfaced that Kyle and husband of 27 years, <strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were separated</a> — which they quickly responded to. “In regards to the news that came out about us today…any claims regarding us divorcing are untrue,” they wrote via Instagram on Monday, July 3. “However, yes, we have had a rough year. The most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>They also cleared the air about any other allegations, including “wrongdoing” in their marriage. “There has been no wrongdoing on anyone’s part,” the reality star and realtor also explained. “Although we are in the public eye, we ask to be able to work through our issues privately. While it may be entertaining to speculate, please don’t create false stories to fit a further salacious narrative.” So without further ado, meet Kyle’s daughters!</p><h2>Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Kyle first married Indonesian commercial land and real estate developer, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Guraish</strong> <strong>Aldjufrie</strong></a>, in 1988. Kyle was just 18 years old at the time and cites their young age as part of the reason for their eventual divorce in 1992. But out of Kyle’s first marriage came <strong>Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie</strong>, who was born on October 31, 1988. Remember when we mentioned Halloween earlier? Well, every year for Farrah’s birthday, Kyle throws a huge bash at her Beverly Hills mansion and calls it – wait for it – “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Farrahween</a>.” It’s good, right? As Kyle’s oldest, Farrah, 33, is the big sister to her younger siblings, with whom she has a very close relationship. Farrah takes after her father, currently working in real estate development with her stepdad at L.A.-based real estate company The Agency. Farrah has been featured on the Netflix series <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Buying Beverly Hills</a>, along with her stepdad and one of her half-sisters, since it premiered in Nov. 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Farrah got engaged to <strong>Alex Manos</strong> in November 2021. She shared the special news on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> with a photo of the happy couple sitting at a table in front of a cake, as Farrah gleefully flashed her gorgeous engagement ring. Fans are hoping that Farrah’s wedding will be on&nbsp;RHOBH.</p><h2>Alexia Simone Umansky</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>In 1994, Kyle met her second husband, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a>, a Los Angeles real estate developer (are we noticing a type?) of Russian and Greek Jewish descent who was born and raised in Mexico. The couple wed on January 20, 1996, when Kyle was four months pregnant, before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>splitting in 2023</a>. On June 18, 1996, they welcomed <strong>Alexia Simone Umansky</strong>, Kyle’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second daughter</a> and her first with Mauricio. Today, Alexia also works for the family business as a real estate developer for The Umansky Team. Alexia is also featured on Netflix’s <i>Buying Beverly&nbsp;Hills&nbsp;</i>with Mauricio and Farrah.</p><h2>Sophia Kylie Umansky</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>Sophia Kylie Umansky</strong> is the second-oldest of Kyle’s three daughters with Mauricio. Sophia was born on January 18, 2000. She’s extremely close to her younger sister (more on that later) and at times the two are inseparable. Sophia became a student at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. in 2018. Sophia graduated in May 2022 and Kyle celebrated her daughter’s accomplishment on Instagram. “So incredibly proud of you @sophiakylieee 😭❤️🙏👩🏻‍🎓,” Kyle wrote alongside a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of Sophia in her cap and gown. “I love you so much & am so proud of you every day. But today my heart was bursting with pride.”</p><h2>Portia Umansky</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Last but certainly not least is young little <strong>Portia Umansky</strong>, who’s actually not so little anymore. Portia was just a toddler when RHOBH premiered in 2010 and we’ve watched her grow up in front of the cameras before our very eyes. And she’s quite the sassy lady today! Portia was born on March 1, 2008. It should come as no surprise that as the youngest of the bunch, Portia really looks up to her big sisters but none so much as Sophia, with who Portia shares a very special bond. In RHOBH‘s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eleventh season</a>, which captured much of the COVID-19 pandemic, Portia was depressed without having Sophia in the house. So to cheer her up, Kyle and Mauricio organized a surprise visit from Sophia, who flew out from the East Coast, just to see her little sister. And, as you can imagine, Portia lost her mind. It was a touching moment and just another testament to how much Kyle loves her daughters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qyo55lop6wqa3RnapmnJGqtKnAxKuqZqOZmcBugJRqbnFsaGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-ewing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Ewing - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Nationality, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./la-mar-taylor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>La Mar Taylor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
