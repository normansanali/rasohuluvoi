Crusoe was shipwrecked, of course, and no one expected that level of realism from Robson, but it was a bit much to turn up aboard a luxury motor launch, posing on the prow like Kate Winslet in Titanic.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/21/3BBD586700000578-0-image-m-48_1483392584967.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Full of 1940s intrigue, sex and Kara Tointon's VERY pert...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/03/00/3BB8832D00000578-0-image-m-33_1483404852831.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>The pathologist's corpses were more lifelike than this...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/01/3BC462D300000578-0-image-a-77_1483322291887.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Poirot meets Peter Pan, and gets the New Year off to a...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/00/3BC3D45800000578-0-image-a-12_1483316831310.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: Sherlock's now so clever-clever, it's...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Within three hours, he was being rescued and rushed to hospital with food poisoning. He spent the next two nights in a makeshift hospital bed at a hotel with a drip in his arm. If there hadn’t been a medical unit on standby, Robson would have been dead on the first day.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the novel, Crusoe was fortunate to find a few of life’s essentials washed ashore. When he returned to the island on Day Three, Robson wasn’t taking that chance — he brought mosquito nets, a tent, shaving cream, a snorkelling mask and flippers, and a canoe.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He also brought swimming trunks, though he didn’t need those. Perching his camera on a rock, he filmed a skinny-dipping sequence — though careful editing spared us the sight of his Man Friday.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In fact, the 100-degree heat did seem to send him quite doolally.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He constructed a soccer team from bamboo poles with coconuts for heads, and spent an afternoon practising his stepover skills as he dribbled past them, commentating as he went. Yes, he’d brought a football, too.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The only bit he took seriously was the fishing: Robson is a keen angler and the main attraction of the trip for him was the chance to drop a line from his canoe in the open ocean, with hermit crabs for bait.</span></p><img id=i-b34f81bf5d89d8fb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/04/00/3BB2CAD100000578-4086096-image-a-108_1483490821724.jpg height=369 width=634 alt="The Great Interior Design Challenge features (left to right) Daniel Hopwood, Tom Dyckhoff and Kelly Hoppen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Great Interior Design Challenge features (left to right) Daniel Hopwood, Tom Dyckhoff and Kelly Hoppen</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Apart from that, it’s hard to see the point of the whole exercise.

Two years is a realistic time frame, not two days. Only the blindest optimists would invite BBC film-makers on a tight budget into their homes, but one couple had such high hopes they were in orbit.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Homeowner Jane wanted her bedroom redone in a style that mingled Versailles and Provence — rustic yet regal. All for a thousand quid in two days, remember.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>No surprise that what she got was peach paint, metallic cushions and a picture frame filled with tatty lace strips. ‘That makes my toes curl,’ Daniel said. ‘I personally don’t like it, that’s my only concern,’ warned Kelly.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>If you’re looking for design ideas, don’t look here.
