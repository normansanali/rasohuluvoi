The story leans into the same romantic, zany vibes of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">other To All the Boys entries</a>. It follows returning character Kitty Covey, who’s finally putting all that experience in love matching to work on her own romantic life. After traveling across the world to reunite with Dae, her long-distance boyfriend, Kitty faces disappointment, rejection, and a gradually more complicated love triangle — or is it a love square, at this point?</p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>That’s how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix itself describes</a> the complicated romantic situation Kitty finds herself in by the end of the season. After spending most of the 10-episode debut season with one eye on Dae and the other drifting ever more toward Yuri, XO, Kitty ended with an unexpected shocker. Fans are still reeling from the unexpected developments contained within the season’s final moments, thanks to Jenny Han’s impeccable grasp of the romantic comedy. This isn’t a boy meets girl, perfect match story, people. Love is simply more complicated than that.</p><h2 id=h-that-surprising-xo-kitty-ending-explained data-injectable=false>That surprising XO, Kitty ending, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>By the end of season one of XO, Kitty, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our rom-com heroine</a>, is split between not two, but three potential love matches. After spending most of the season working to get Dae back, the perky Kitty polishes off the final episode broken up with the boy she moved across the world to be with, and having just missed her shot at another potential romance.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>See, mid-way through the season, as Kitty is working to iron things out with Dae, she starts to develop feelings (other than simple hatred) for her rival, Yuri. While the two spend much of the first half of the season at odds, Kitty starts to realize that her feelings for Yuri go much deeper. She starts to wonder if the two of them might have a future together, only to miss her shot at telling Yuri how she feels.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>That leaves her, at the end of the season, with a recent breakup, no confessed feelings, and a long trip back home to look forward to. That’s before she arrives at the airport, recently single, and in a kismet moment made for rom-com television, sees Yuri. Her moment to admit her feelings feels at hand, only to be dashed when it’s revealed that Yuri is at the airport to pick up her girlfriend. Another opportunity lost.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>It seems, for a moment, like XO, Kitty is simply taking a hard left turn from the typical rom-com offering. Instead of ending the season with Kitty in a relationship, bubbly and excited for what is to come, it allows her story to conclude — for now, at least — with Kitty instead examining herself, her own feelings, and her hopes for the future. She doesn’t need a partner to move forward, and that lesson is vital in a show like this.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>But that’s not the end. While it feels like the show was gearing up to end on that note, XO, Kitty couldn’t let us off that easy, now, could it? It took that left turn and made it into a full-blown U-turn, by tossing Min Ho back into the mix. The studley, affluent boy served as a bit of a tease in trailers for the show, but it turns out he wasn’t just a tease after all. He admitted, in the season’s final moments, that he has feelings for Kitty, and in the process transformed her complicated love triangle into a square.</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=false>The season leaves off with Kitty facing quite the romantic hurdle. She and Dae are broken up, but that doesn’t eliminate her feelings for him, and she’s only just come to understand her feelings for Yuri. Now, with Min Ho tossed into the mix, her heart is getting pulling in three separate directions. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">next season of the series</a> — assuming Netflix veers from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its trend of cancelations</a> and renews it — will surely see things get even more complicated for Kitty, and we can’t wait.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y5u4ykoK2sqWLAqbvCpKCnn12au6W1zaBknrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cuba-migrants-hang-glider-florida-60a62ee064288d273189eb49b1763884.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>2 Cuban migrants fly into Florida on motorized hang glider</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-ferrell-and-mark-wahlberg-to-throw-around-the-ol-pigskin-shriek-at-each-other-in-turkey-bowl-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will Ferrell And Mark Wahlberg To Throw Around The Ol Pigskin, Shriek At Each Other in Turkey Bow</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
