Despite their immense popularity as one of the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popular groups in the current K-Pop scene</a>, no one is exempt from controversy, particularly when under the prying eyes of the devoted South Korean fanbase, known for their unwavering loyalty and intense passion, which can be both inspiring and also unforgiving.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=600 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Despite being the provider of some of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the biggest hits in the South Korean music universe</a>, the “God’s Menu” musician is still not able to evade the scrutiny from fans, as his latest livestream would go on to show. Partaking in his usual YouTube segment Chan’s Room, where the singer sits down to chat with fans during the live broadcast, Bang Chan touches on a few aspects of his life, including his current endeavors and promotional features. On his May 14 episode, Bang Chan talked about a few controversial subjects that set off a few fans, and here’s what happened.</p><h2 id=h-what-did-bang-chan-say data-injectable=false>What did Bang Chan say?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>Touching on an array of topics related to his recent ventures, Chan also expressed his thoughts on Music Bank Paris, a music event that was held in the European capital on April 8. During his attendance, the idol candidly acknowledged that certain rookie idols from the fourth generation of K-Pop seemed to be lacking in fundamental manners, crucial to Asian and South Korean culture, particularly in terms of showing respect to their industry seniors.</p><p>“I don’t know, I might sound like a boomer, because generations are different, and I’m well aware of that, but I feel like it’s come to the point where greeting someone is not considered a basic manner anymore. If you see someone walk by, and you say hi, but then, if they don’t reply back, it’d be like, ‘What the…? Okay…’ But I feel like it’s come to the point where this generation is allowed to do that. [To] just not care, because there were a few scenarios where that happened.”</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>This particular gripe wasn’t targeted toward any group or person, but rather, at a few anonymous idols belonging to and growing in the current generation of K-Pop, which houses idols as young as 14 years old. As it tends to occur in this industry, everyone seems to believe that any criticism is targeted toward themselves or their favorite artists, and fans of some of the newest groups in K-Pop did not take the comment lightly.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>his fandoms is the problem.. attacked ive meanwhile he didn’t mentioned ive on that live and dont forget he was praising them tho.<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xO6OZCA7NX</a></p>— squen🍒 (@Wonyhu) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>agreed with knetz on this one, he should’ve know that he has a large fandom which is if he talk about things like this openly to his fans the result will be (the fans) hate & talking bad about other idol just ike what happened last time he said the same thing.</p>— 선 (@vsmvyzkdlin) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a><h2 data-injectable=false>Bang Chan’s apology</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stray Kids (@realstraykids)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>As a consequence of the backlash, although supported by numerous defenders who considered the situation utterly ridiculous and exaggerated, Chan found himself compelled to address the issue. Taking to Instagram, the singer issued an apology directed toward K-Pop fans and fellow industry peers, expressing remorse for his recent remarks that may have unintentionally caused hurt to idols present at the event.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Moreover, Chan also confirmed that the name that had been prominently arising among speculations was wrong and that IVE – a rising K-Pop girl group – was not the artist he had directed his comments toward. Promising to be more careful about his words in the future, Chan ended the letter with one last apology towards everyone, with hopeful fans in the comments wishing for this raging situation to finally cease.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Despite having already apologized, the controversy surrounding the comments continues to generate intense discussions on social media, as more and more fans weigh in on the subject. With some agreeing that the new generation has lost touch with humility and fundamental manners, while others dismiss Chan’s remarks as inappropriate, this unfortunate situation is still prominent in K-Pop circles.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, as many K-Pop fans are aware, these topics tend to run amok among Korean fans and they easily get blown out of proportion. Hopefully, with this somewhat unnecessary apology, there is hope that this ongoing discussion will finally draw to a close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpuinF2Xrq%2BzjJyfmqZdmbxutMisZKyskamyrrHNrWSappRirrG7y6ieop2jYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-graham-potter-wife-family-salary-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Graham Potter?
