In today's day and age, it is important to capitalize on these public inside jokes as you never know who might try to steal them from you. Having said that, it appears as though Williams has successfully trademarked the "Lemon Pepper Lou" name which means we can see some merchandise on the horizon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite his Magic City slip up, Williams and the Clippers have been cruising throughout these NBA playoffs. They are currently up 3-1 on the Denver Nuggets and are in the lead in Game 5. If they win tonight, they will go to the Western Conference Finals where they will most likely take on the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Needless to say, Williams is living the good life right now.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
