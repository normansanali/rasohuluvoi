In November 2012, Gray was given interim guardianship of Winter after their mother, Chrisoula Workman, was accused of being physically and emotionally abusive to her. Workman lobbied the court for custody on behalf of their mother, claiming that Gray allowed Winter to be “sexualized” in public, exploited Winter to promote her acting school, and used the money Winter earned as a cast member of the TV show Modern Family to fund “lavish parties and limousines,” all of which Workman claimed had torn their family apart. Glenn Workman, who was in charge of Winter’s estate, was also unqualified, according to Workman, because of his low financial status, which rendered him subject to manipulation by Gray and her counsel.</p><p>In May 2014, the parties agreed to a settlement in which Gray would keep custody of Winter while Glenn kept control of her funds and filed mandatory reports with the court. Winter would remain under the supervision of Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy until she turned 18 (January 28, 2016), while Gray and Chrisoula later published a statement saying they were working toward reconciliation.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"For More Bio:&nbsp;Sheri Easterling, Mason Olivia Grammer, Seraina Schonenberger, Celebrity Child"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1049089,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":14,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":30}{"1":32,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":52}{"1":54,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":75}{"1":77,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":14,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sheri-easterling/"}{"1":30}{"1":32,"2":"https://popularbio.com/mason-olivia-grammer/"}{"1":52}{"1":54,"2":"https://popularbio.com/seraina-schonenberger/"}{"1":75}{"1":77,"2":"https://popularbio.com/keilani-bautista/"}{"1":92}'>For More Bio:&nbsp;<a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sheri Easterling</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Mason Olivia Grammer</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Seraina Schonenberger</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Child</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>A Look Into Nick Gehlfuss And Lilian Matsuda Married Life</a></h3>There has been Nick Gehlfuss for a very long time.
