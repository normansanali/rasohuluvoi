What isn't argued is how good yet tough his life truly is. He made that crazy amount of money. He has an interesting backstory which makes him even more entertaining as a player. Prescott has no issue telling about his private life.</p><p>That extends to the romantic side of things, a part of his personal world that most fans really aren't that aware of despite his openness about it. He recently went through a tough breakup but has rebounded with someone else. Here's everything to know about the Dallas athlete's romantic life, and what has truly transpired over the past few years.</p><h2 id=why-did-dak-prescott-and-natalie-buffett-break-up>Why Did Dak Prescott And Natalie Buffett Break Up?</h2><p>Oftentimes, <a href=#>NFL players get with other celebrities</a> on their level of fame and status. That isn't really the case for Prescott and his latest long-term relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prescott’s 2021 NFL campaign didn't end so well. Prescott and the Cowboys lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL's Wild Card round. However, Prescott's nightmare didn't end there, as he also ended things with model Natalie Buffett, Page Six announced.</p><p>The couple was believed to have broken up in March 2022, although things weren't confirmed until 2023.</p><p>Just how were things beforehand? Here's an exact timeline of how things were, and why exactly they split from each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dak-prescott-and-natalie-buffett.jpg><p>The two confirmed their relationship when Buffett posted about Prescott's birthday on Instagram in 2020.

Then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as Page Six recently reported</a>, things ended in March 2022. It took nearly an entire year for this information to come out, with not many people noticing her absence throughout the 2022 campaign.</p><p>It's unknown why exactly they broke up, although according to that Page Six report, Prescott was "casually dating" afterward. Now, however, rumors of a new lover have appeared publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-dak-prescott-and-jadyn-jannasch-39-s-relationship>Everything To Know About Dak Prescott And Jadyn Jannasch's Relationship</h2><p>Prescott's newest girlfriend has piqued the internet's interest for a multitude of reasons. One, obviously, has to do with Prescott's position as the quarterback of America's team. The other has to do with who exactly Prescott's girlfriend is - an LSU swimmer and Instagram model, Jadyn Jannasch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jadyn-jannasch.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Sportskeeda</a>, Prescott is currently dating Jannasch, and that the pair were "active" during the 2022 holidays. An insider from Page Six claimed that this is a "rebound relationship" for Prescott, especially given the circumstances. Prescott is an athlete for an NFL team, while Jannasch is an LSU student.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Little Known Facts About The Dallas Cowboys' Cheerleaders</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Page Six</a>, Jannasch is the daughter of Jeff Jannasch, the owner of Texas's Town Square Mortgage. Jeff once posted a picture of himself with Prescott on Instagram, and it's been confirmed that Jeff has a business relationship with the Cowboys.</p><p>Jenna's college athletic record is rather impressive. Jannasch once was awarded third place in a 100-yard breaststroke, quite an impressive feat considering the athletic landscape LSU is in. Not every swimmer can make it to LSU, let alone win in breathtaking fashion like Jannasch has.</p><p>That's pretty much all essential and confirmed information about their relationship at the moment, which gives enough clues and insight into their relationship. Is it really love, or is this just a rebound relationship for Prescott?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-dak-prescott-truly-love-jadyn-jannasch>Does Dak Prescott Truly Love Jadyn Jannasch?</h2><p>While a lot of information has come out about Jannasch, and a decent amount of details about their relationship, the answer to this question isn't quite so obvious. Both sides seem to be fine with where things are at now, but there's more than meets the eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dak-prescott.jpg><p>First things first - what exactly is a rebound relationship?</p><p>Rebound relationships can mean different things to different people. Typically, a rebound relationship is one that is entered into shortly after the end of a previous relationship. Yes, that fits the description of this particular saga.</p><p>The term “rebound” suggests that the person is recovering from a breakup and looking for someone new to help them move on. For that to be the case, Prescott needed to have been crazily in love with Buffett. Given the social media posts and how much PDA they had on social media and on the red carpets, that appears to be true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that context, it's easy to point to Prescott and Jannasch's fling as a rebound relationship of sorts. However, it is important to note that not all relationships that begin soon after a breakup are rebound relationships. Just because those insiders close to the situation believe it is, doesn't mean the two aren't growing feelings for each other.</p><p>At this point, they've been seeing each other for at least 6 months. Rebounds don't normally last that long, at least if one goes by the average description of a rebound relationship. According to Page Six, Prescott and Jannasch have been "more active" since the holiday season, meaning things are definitely heating up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/does-dak-prescott-truly-love-jadyn-jannasch-or-is-she-just-a-rebound-girlfriend-following-his-breakup-with-natalie-buffett_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the timeline, Jannasch was there by Prescott's side after his devastating loss to the 49ers. That can certainly help accelerate things if she gave him the love and support he needed, as true love and feelings grow from tough times.</p><p>Many fans dislike Patrick Mahome's wife Brittany. <a href=#>She's angered countless celebrities as well</a>. However, she's been by his side during countless big losses, which has undoubtedly been a huge factor in their relationship's success. The same could be said for Gisele Bundchen, <a href=#>who's claimed she's "sacrificed" enough of her life</a> to be by Tom Brady's side.</p><p>If Prescott and Jannasch are to be successful, they'll certainly need to learn from those couple's playbooks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqNdpb%2Bmv8Koq61lmpaxurqMo5inppGosKl50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZKudkqTCr7CMoKmipJantqa6w2aYn6yVp3qjvsSaoq6oXay2tbSMp5itmZyesm6u1J%2BdnqykZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ebi-eats.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ebi Eats Wiki, Age, Death Height, Education &amp;amp; Girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-kathy-create-unnecessary-drama-on-the-golden-bachelor-or-was-it-theresa-who-took-things-a-step-too-far.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Kathy create unnecessary drama on the Golden Bachelor, or was it Theresa who took things a</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
