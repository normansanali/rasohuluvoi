I bet they’ll be all ears now.</p><p>I am here to tell you one of the most fun ways that you can enjoy the wizarding world with this Harry Potter<a href=#> <strong>drinking game</strong></a> and make watching Harry Potter something that even the muggles in your group will enjoy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-potter-drinking-game>Harry Potter Drinking Game</h2><figure class="aligncenter size-large"></figure><p>The best thing about the Harry Potter drinking game is that you can swap and change the rules to suit you.</p><p>I think this is great because it means that you can adapt the game to your group or whatever you have to hand. For instance, you can use only shots and sips, or you can involve cocktail making or down a bottle of beer.</p><p>There are so many variations that the possibilities are endless. It’s all down to you.</p><p>We can play the game with all 8 Harry Potter movies, and you can adapt it to suit each film personally if you want to make it more complicated.</p><p>You don’t need to worry too much if you’re not overly familiar with all the movies, though it will give the Potter heads in your group the upper hand when they’re competing against you, so be alert because they will sense your weakness and use it against you.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. I love all the<a href=#> <strong>Harry Potter games</strong></a> out there, but the best part about this one is that it usually results in being drunk. Winner!</p><p>Below, I will tell you my favorite version of the game and the rules I like to use when playing.</p><p>One thing I have to advise is that you will see there that the game is broken down into sections such as “sip your drink” or “<strong>take a shot</strong>.”</p><p>I have thought about these very carefully because, of course, if you took a shot every time you see a wand, or see Ron Weasley, then it would be a pretty short game, and your group could end up going home relatively early and a bit worse for wear.</p><p>And let’s face it, we should cut no Harry Potter game or movie short for any reason!</p><p>So, wands at the ready!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-you-ll-need-to-play>What You’ll Need to Play?</h2><p>To play this Harry Potter drinking game, you will need access to Amazon Prime or any other streaming service with Harry Potter available. Or you can always purchase the movies on DVD from<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> <strong>Amazon</strong></a>. Though if you’re a potter fan, you’ll already have all eight of these in your collection.</p><p>You will, of course, need an excellent selection of alcohol. I recommend having a couple of different mixers, a choice of spirits, wine, something for shots, and maybe some light beers.</p><p>Last, you will need a good group of Potter heads and muggles who are up for a laugh.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rules-gameplay>Rules & Gameplay</h2><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"></figure><p>The idea of the game is that each time something specific happens on screen, you must take action regarding your drink, such as downing your bottle of beer, sipping your cocktail, or throwing back a shot of something sour.</p><p>The rules are, well, your own. You can choose phrases or actions and decide which drink goes with what. But stay mindful. Remember, some phrases appear a lot, so keep those for sipping.</p><p>There is no limit on how many people can play this. But, it’s an<a href=#> <strong>excellent group game</strong></a>, and ‌the more, the better, as long as everyone will take part.</p><p>It can get a little distracting if one person wants to chatter all the way through, so if you have that person in your group, you know what you need to do. Petrificus Totalus!</p><p>You should have four drinking categories: <strong>neck a beer bottle</strong>, <strong>make a cocktail</strong>, <strong>take a shot</strong>, or <strong>sip your drink</strong>. You could even add different types.</p><p>For example, we like to have one drink we know everyone hates in the middle of the table, and every so often, throw in a wild card phrase or scene by shouting “<strong>Riddikulus</strong>!”</p><p>They should then announce what everyone needs to look out for and what action they must take; the last person to complete their action has to drink the wild card drink. Each player gets to call out one wild card per movie.</p><p>Believe it or not, this game has other benefits besides drinking and getting your Harry Potter fix. It also helps us use our concentration skills and keeps the mind alert. See, Harry Potter works its magic in all areas.</p><p>So, let me tell you about some phrases and actions that I use when playing the Harry Potter drinking game. This will give you a good idea about what to include in your game but don’t forget that you can go anywhere with this part, so use your imagination.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-surprise-mix>1. Surprise Mix</h3><p>If you’re an expert in the<a href=#> <strong>drinking games</strong></a> forte, you will probably be well prepared and have many drinks ready on game night. This can come in handy when you’re playing the Harry Potter drinking game because you can use it as one of the actions of your game.</p><p>For example, when you see or hear a phrase from the list below, make a small drink for the person to your right. Do this by using any combination of drinks on the table. Here are some of my favorites for the Surprise Mix part of the game.</p><ul><li>Someone says Harry has his mother’s eyes</li><li>You hear the spell “<strong>Alohomora</strong>.”</li><li>Harry uses his invisibility cloak</li><li>Someone produces an unforgivable curse</li><li>Malfoy talks about his father</li><li>The Marauders Map is used</li><li>A banquet is held in the great hall</li><li>Molly Weasley scolds Ron, George, and Fred</li><li>The Whomping Willow is on screen</li><li>Snape swishes his cloak</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-shots-shots-shots>2. Shots, Shots, Shots!</h3><p>Are you brave enough to take part when shots are involved?</p><p>If you’re slightly apprehensive, or you’re still recovering from that lousy night on tequila you can’t get over, don’t worry; it doesn’t have to be hardcore.</p><p>The shot can be anything you like. Personally, my friends and I want to use fruit-flavored Sourz. They aren’t too strong in alcohol, and the sour flavor adds extra entertainment.</p><p>Here are some parts of the movies I like to save for shots.</p><ul><li>Hermione breaks the rules.</li><li>Harry talks about his mum or dad.</li><li>Anyone flies a broomstick.</li><li>Any students are in the library.</li><li>Filch enters a room.</li><li>Hagrid says, “<strong>I shouldn’t have said that</strong>.”</li><li>Dobby says, “<strong>Harry Potter</strong>.”</li><li>The Dursleys scold Harry.</li><li>Harry says, “<strong>Expelliarmus</strong>.”</li><li>Someone says, “<strong>Lumos.</strong>“</li><li>Dumbledore winks.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-down-the-drink>3. Down The Drink</h3><p>This one will make you think carefully about what you’re drinking for the night because, at some points throughout the game, you might have to finish it all in one go.&nbsp;</p><p>Each time you hear or see one of the following situations, or ones you’ve made up yourself, you best be ready to finish that drink immediately.</p><ul><li>Harry plays quidditch.</li><li>Two people kiss.</li><li>Anyone is taken to the hospital wing.</li><li>Harry almost dies.</li><li>Ron saves the day.</li><li>Someone dies.</li><li>Neville forgets something.</li><li>A snake is seen.</li><li>Sirius says, “<strong>Harry</strong>.”</li><li>Snape casts a spell.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-sip-your-drink>4. Sip Your Drink</h3><p>This is fun because it happens more often, and the things you’re looking out for are much harder to spot and keep on top of.</p><p>These frequent actions will require you to take just a drink from your table. Another reason to ensure your drink isn’t too strong is that things could go downhill fast. Here are some actions I refer to in this category.</p><ul><li>Someone casts a spell.</li><li>Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in the Great Hall.</li><li>Hedwig is on screen.</li><li>Hermione rolls her eyes.</li><li>Malfoy says, “<strong>Potter</strong>.”</li><li>Fred and George pull a prank.</li><li>The word “<strong>Muggle</strong>” is used.</li><li>Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid’s hut.</li><li>Ron Weasley says, “<strong>Bloody Hell</strong>.”</li><li>There is a magical creature on the screen.</li><li>You see, a ghost.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-summary>Summary</h2><p>And there we have it. That’s my favorite way to play the Harry Potter drinking game. But don’t forget that you can make this game your own, and make it as adventurous and challenging as you like.</p><p>But one thing that I can’t stress enough about this game is to please ensure you are drinking responsibly over anything else.</p><p>Now, why not look at some other<a href=#> <strong>wizard-related games</strong></a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiakae0ornErGhpaV6YvK57x5qpq7Fdpby1wMSrZJ2qmaO4qrrGZp6apZVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-can-i-make-my-electric-scooter-faster.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How can I make my electric scooter faster?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gwendoline-christies-path-to-hollywood-stardom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gwendoline Christie's Path To Hollywood Stardom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
