These women are among Dallas' social elite and they have the wallets to prove it. This city's cast is full of unique professions, from Dallas Cowboys cheerleader to surgical assistant. The Housewife with the most star power, though, is definitely Tiffany Hendra. And, star power is one thing, but <a href=# class=T3D>what's Tiffany Hendra's <i>RHOD</i> net worth?</a></p><p>Well, Tiffany has had a career in entertainment that spans many more years than I had originally pegged her for. According to her Bravo profile, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>she has worked as an actress</a>, TV host, and model in Los Angeles for over 15 years. She even had a starring/recurring role on a Cinemax series called, <i>Black Tie Nights. </i>Unfortunately, because the project was on Cinemax and included Tiffany going topless, she has been labeled as a "former adult film star" by a lot of media outlets. While she refutes that label, she doesn't shy away from the fact that she was involved in some racy projects. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Tiffany told The Mr. Real Housewife</a> that she has no regrets, saying, “So what I showed my t*ts and had love scenes, but what actress hasn’t? I did that series before I was married and it’s part of my journey. I own it.”</p><p>You go, girl. I think she's amazing for owning her past. And, she has certainly moved on to bigger and better things nowadays.</p><p>Tiffany's most obvious new source of income is her role on <i>Real Housewives Of Dallas. </i>According to Lalate news<i>,</i> each cast member is<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> reportedly making $11,000 per episode</a>. If true, that would mean Tiffany will be making $110,000 for the entire first season. It's Dallas' first season, so that's pretty good start.</p><p>After moving back to Dallas from Los Angeles to be closer to her family, Tiffany has thrown herself into her lifestyle blog and YouTube channel, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sanctuary Of Style</a>. As part of her lifestyle brand, she is selling "Tiffirmation Tees" with inspiring quotes on them <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>through her website</a>. The shirts go for about $22-$26 and are actually really cute. New styles are promised on her site to be coming soon, too. The same site also showcases her husband's CDs and Aaron Hendra apparel for sale. So, she's definitely cashing in on her new notoriety. I don't blame her! Add that source of income to her bankroll.</p><p>According to net-worth.com, Tiffany reportedly has an estimated <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>net worth of $1.8 million as of 2016</a>. That's not even including the fact that she is married to a pretty successful musician whose star is also on the rise.</p><p>After 15 years of a successful career in the entertainment industry, it's no wonder that she has a pretty full wallet. Her net worth will only increase with her time as a Real Housewife.</p><p><i>Images: Michael Larsen/Bravo;</i> <i>Trae Patton/NBCUniversal</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygZRra2tlpJ6zp63NsmShnZ6Zv6K%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIysn6ivo2LBqbGMq5yapF2dvLa%2FxLCgr52jYrynecOao6WZo2K2tHnDqKCnn12ssq24jJ%2Bmq2WYmr%2B0scuf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-in-a-topps-hobby-box.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is in a Topps Hobby Box?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-challenges-ct-tamburello-wife-lili-solares-separated.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Challenge's CT Tamburello, Wife Lili Solares Separated</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
