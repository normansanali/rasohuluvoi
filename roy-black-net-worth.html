He is also the attorney who secured an acquittal for William Kennedy Smith on charges of rape. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Roy Black? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $65 million, mostly earned through a successful career in law. He’s represented many celebrities including <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=#>Jeffrey Epstein</a>, Peter Max, <a href=#>Joe Francis</a>, and <a href=#>Kelsey Grammer</a>, and all of these achievements at law have helped ensure the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Roy Black Net Worth $65 million</h3><p>Roy’s parents divorced soon after his birth and his mother would remarry in 1951; the family moved to Connecticut and then Jamaica, but he returned to the US to study at the University of Miami. He graduated in 1967, and would then attend the University Of Miami School Of Law, gaining a Juris Doctor, then attaining the highest possible score on the Florida Bar Exam. He began work as an assistant public defender, while also working as an adjunct professor at the University of Miami, teaching on criminal evidence.</p><p>His high profile cases have elevated both his popularity and net worth, plus attracting further high profile clients. He is currently a partner in Black, Srebnick, Kornspan, & Stumpf which is a trial firm based in Miami, specializing in criminal defense and civil litigation. Black has been noted for his eloquent delivery of arguments in the courtroom; he mentions that he handles cases which the client can’t afford to lose. He reads and stays up to date on the latest techniques, and also watches trial footage and learns from other lawyers much like a musician. Another notable case he handled was the Miami officer William Lozano who was charged with manslaughter in shooting a black motorcyclist. He lost the case, then successfully appealed, leading to an acquittal in the retrial.</p><p>Apart from his work as a lawyer, he is often seen on television providing legal commentary from news programs on NBC. He also became part of the reality competition series “The Law Firm” in which he became the managing partner, so deciding which lawyer would be eliminated each week as they compete against each other; the show has been called a legal version of “The Apprentice”. These opportunities have also helped in increasing his net worth.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Roy has been married three times. Not much is known about his first marriage, but his second marriage was to Naomi Morris Black in 1984; they have a daughter. In 1994 he married Lisa Lea Haller, who was in the cast of “The Real Housewives of Miami”. She served as a juror in the William Kennedy Smith trial and the two began dating months after the trial.
