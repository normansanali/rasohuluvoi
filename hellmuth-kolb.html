I’d like to buy her for $100,000.”</p><p>Benning said his offer left her in “complete shock.”</p><p>When bystanders intervened, Kolb reportedly laughed at them.

Mr. Kolb should have simply stuck to just grocery shopping.”</p><p>Kolb, unbeknownst to Benning at the time, was already a registered sex offender and on probation for a similar charge from 2018, when he attempted to purchase a different child.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Newsweek</a>, the 2018 incident involved Kolb grabbing a young girl at Walmart, kissing her wrist, and offering to buy her for $200,000.</p><p>At the time, Kolb had reportedly observed the girl and her mother sitting on a bench and began “bidding” on the child. The mother declined and tried to leave with her daughter, which is when Kolb then grabbed the girl’s arm.</p><p>He was sentenced to five years of probation for battery and false imprisonment.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-395553 alt="Hellmuth Kolb In 2018" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hellmuth-kolb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-395553 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ABC 7 Chicago/Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>Kolb had filed for early termination of his probation less than a month before his arrest, but a judge had not yet approved the motion.</span></p><p>As part of his probation, Kolb was forbidden to have contact with minors other than family members or to go into large stores without supervision.</p><p>His most recent attempt clearly violates those terms, and he’s now being held without bond.</p><p>“His intent is to buy children,” Benning said. “That’s not okay… He needs to be locked up and not allowed to be around our children.”</p><p>Benning reported that her daughter is alright after the incident with Kolb, though she was shaken up by the strange, uncomfortable encounter.
