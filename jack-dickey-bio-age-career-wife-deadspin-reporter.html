He and his team did intense research and published the article in less than 5 days he got hold of the scoop.</p><p>Let’s hear his side of the story along with information on his dating or married life. So, keep on scrolling down starting with!</p><h3><strong>Netflix’s The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist: Meet Jack Dickey, The Deadspin Reporter</strong></h3><p>Jack Dickey was a college student at the time who was passionate about sports and worked a part-time job between his studies and was “way behind” on his senior thesis. He was busy breaking one of the biggest, strangest stories to hit the sports world ever. He co-wrote Manti Te’o hoax story for <a href=#>Deadspin</a> with Timothy Burke.</p><p>As the story goes, it all began with a tip. Manti had received extensive media attention in the fall of 2012 when he said his grandmother and girlfriend died within a few hours of one another. But the girlfriend never existed.</p><p>“I was at home in Guilford when we got the tip as a staff,” Dickey told New Haven Register. “I thought to myself, ‘This is awesome, I’m going to look into this.'” The more he and Timothy investigated, the more they realized this was a substantial scoop. However, Jack didn’t understand the true scope of their revelation until Deadspin, its entire staff worked to pull everything together in just five days.</p><p>“[Deadspin editor-in-chief] Tommy Craggs and Burke helped me research on Friday afternoon, and then Tim and I spent all weekend, and all of Monday and most of Tuesday, looking into the mystery of this story. [Writers] Dom Cosentino and Tom Ley made a bunch of calls then too. Then Craggs and [managing editor] Tom Scocca edited the thing on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, and then we were basically ready to go.”</p><p>Speaking more about the working relationship with Timothy, he told <a href=#>ThePostGame</a>, “Burke and I divided and conquered both on the reporting and on the writing. With the reporting, Burke took social media while I focused on the press’s accounts of Kekua — both broadcast and print. Then, once we started to get a fuller picture of the characters involved — Monday morning or so — Burke tracked down the woman who was in the photos of Lennay, and some of the people who had alleged Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was behind the hoax.”</p><p>Jack added, “I was simultaneously trying to piece together Ronaiah Tuiasosopo’s life story, and trying to find people who knew him. Burke had a lot more breaks than I did in this process. He had a handful of people who talked to him; I made probably 20 calls and left more Facebook messages and got only one guy on the phone. (I really wanted to talk to Ronaiah, but he didn’t answer me or Craggs.)”</p><p>They published the article on 16 January 2013. The story became breaking news on an international scale.</p><p>“It was kind of a surprise,” Dickey said. “We thought it would be a big college football story that would have a big impact on sports media. It had a much bigger impact outside of that that we didn’t expect.” By February 2013, the story was viewed 4 million times. Being a co-author, he received international exposure which followed countless interviews and even a few TV appearances.</p><p>“I did all the trashy tabloid shows like Inside Edition, Extra, and Access Hollywood,” Jack says. “Tim was on, like, Anderson Cooper and MSNBC.” He realized it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>At the time, Jack explained, “I’m never topping this. I don’t think it’s possible. This is the biggest story in the history of this website. … For us to have a scoop like this again, I can’t foresee that ever happening again. Of course, I’d love it if it did.”</p><h3><strong>Jack Dickey Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1990, Jack Dickey is 31 years old as of Aug 2022.
