If they don't do well on the test, they have no chance at earning a Chinese university degree, and face bleak job prospects.</p><p>Thus, students desperate to get a good score are known to take IV amino acid drips for studying energy and even enter hyperbaric oxygen chambers to reduce stress. Sometimes, the stress can prove fatal: In 2011, student Lü Pin committed suicide by jumping from his sixth floor dorm on the first day of the test.</p><p>Outside of changes in a student’s behavior, cities shut down during the test. Airplanes are rerouted, factories are closed, and car-horn honking is forbidden. Even in 2008 during the Summer Olympics, the torch relay route was moved so as not to disturb gaokao test takers.</p><p>Given the fact that more and more students are leaving China to attend college abroad — and that, as critics suggest, the test promotes memorization instead of learning, has a deleterious impact on students’ mental and emotional state, and is actually discriminatory given its region-based quota system -- some have begun to call for an end to gaokao.</p><p>As Chinese talk show host Zhong Shan said, "Is there no way at all we can avoid having the younger generation, the future of our nation, grow up in such a fearful, desperate and cruel atmosphere?"</p><p>In the end, though, numbers alone might spell gaokao's demise.
