One of them seems to be following in their parent's footsteps, and it's their little girl Daisy Josephine Sudeikis.</p><p class=dh>Daisy Josephine Sudeikis' parents began dating in 2011 and became engaged in 2012. However, the ex-fiancees called separated amicably in 2020, per People's source, followed by a contentious custody battle.</p><p class=dh>That same year, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Olivia shared how much she appreciated spending more time with Daisy and her younger sibling. How she made pancakes for her kids and called them her little best friends.</p><p class=dh>Daisy Josephine is the youngest of her family, but she is already displaying her talents in the acting world. The little actress was named after quite a few of her family members, and she knows how to make her dad laugh.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Arrival of Daisy Josephine</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Daisy Josephine Sudeikis's mother, Olivia Wilde, shared the news of her expectancy in April 2016 with her supporters on Instagram. The actress reportedly posted a black and white photo of herself and her son, revealing her growing <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/jason-sudeikis-olivia-wilde-welcome-daughter-daisy-josephine/>baby bump</a>.</p><p class=dh>From then onward, the mom-of-two continued sharing the progress of her baby bump right until Daisy Josephine's arrival. In June of that year, Wilde spoke to People about her pregnancy, which she described as a beautiful experience and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jason-sudeikis-olivia-wilde-welcome-daughter-daisy-josephine/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It is a time when you feel very connected to your body."</p><p class=dh>Two months later, Wilde revealed Daisy Josephine's gender, and on October 11, 2016, the actress's daughter drew her first breath. Daisy Josephine's mom took to Instagram once more to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLmF-nsDXkp/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=8ac057ee-b986-471f-a7f1-7fda13148f46">announce her arrival</a>, revealing her full name and saying she was "born like a boss."</p><p class=dh>Interestingly, Daisy Josephine shares her initials with her dad, whose full name is Daniel Jason Sudeikis. During an appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," the actor broke down the origins of his secondborn's name.</p><p class=dh>Sudeikis explained that his ex-fiancee had a cousin named Daisy, and when Wilde suggested they named their daughter the same, he thought it was perfect. Daisy Josephine's middle name comes from both her maternal and paternal ancestry.</p><p class=dh>She shares 'Josephine' with her great-great-grandmother from Wilde's side of the family. Moreover, as the "We're The Millers" actor added, Daisy Josephine's great-great-grandfather's name was Joseph, and Sudeikis's father's middle name is also Joseph.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Relationships with Parents</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Daisy Josephine Sudeikis was only five years old when she secured her first acting credit. The toddler cameoed in this year's "Don't Worry Darlings," starring as Wilde's daughter in a pool scene. The film also co-stars musician and actor Harry Styles alongside Marvel's Florence Pugh.</p><p class=dh>During her appearance on "The Late Night Show With Stephen Colbert," Daisy Josephine's mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8p2tV_eOCA&t=66s">gushed</a> about having her daughter on set. Wilde appreciated the notion of Daisy Josephine watching her mother in her element, calling the shots while being supported by her crew.</p><p class=dh>Wilde also praised her daughter's performance and admitted that she was a little meaner in the film than she would typically be to Daisy Josephine. Regardless, she was happy that Daisy Josephine would grow up knowing that women could take up influential positions and lead.</p><p class=dh>Daisy Josephine seems to have also inherited her dad's comedic prowess with a little joke that she always plays on him when he drops her and her older brother at school. Sudeikis recounted when Daisy Josephine would pretend to be asleep before he opened the car door as he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/jason-sudeikis-daughter-daisy-school-drop-off-joke-exclusive/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It always makes me laugh. You can kind of see that she's looking through it, and she's just smiling. And I'm like, 'Oh no, Daisy fell asleep! Oh no, oh no!' And she'll start giggling, and that always makes me laugh."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Daisy Has an Older Brother</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Daisy Josephine Sudeikis has a brother, who is two years her elder, named Otis Alexander Sudeikis. Otis Alexander took his first breath on April 20, 2014, and was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/all-about-jason-sudeikis-olivia-wilde-kids/>named after</a> Otis Redding.</p><p class=dh>His mother, rumored to be dating her co-star <a class="me a" href=#>Harry Styles</a> since 2020, confessed she was a big fan of the famous singer-songwriter. Per the 2018 People issue, Wilde disclosed Daisy Josephine's brother's love for singing.</p><p class=dh>She added that Otis Alexander loved Moana and thoroughly enjoyed Beyonce's music. Otis Alexander's music interest grew keener as his mother once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CEsqr88HEda/>shared a clip</a> of him playing drums. The Sudeikis's firstborn also loved dunking basketballs in his room while still learning to walk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbmxoa3qlrcissGain6iysbTIp5xmq6WZsqq3yKxkpKafrMButM6wZKaZm5p7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-dennis-rodman-have-a-son.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Dennis Rodman Have a Son?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chicago-fire-shares-tributes-for-treat-williams.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chicago Fire shares tributes for Treat Williams</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
