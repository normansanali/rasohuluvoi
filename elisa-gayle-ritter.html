This is understandable, given that opening up can be incredibly challenging, and people see celebrities as if they are almost not human. Elisa Gayle Ritter is one of those hidden-in-the-dark characters. The ex-wife of music producer and talent manager Narvel Blackstock, Elisa helped to build the building blocks in Narvel’s career as a talent manager. But since his rise to fame, Narvel rarely talks about his first wife. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Elisa Gayle Ritter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Marriage:</h2><p>Elisa Gayle Ritter was born on the 6th of January 1956 in Tarrant County, Texas. Born and raised in Texas, there is very little information about Elisa’s early life and parents. She met Narvel when she was quite young and the pair began dating soon after. Narvel and Elisa married when they were just 17 years old. They tied the knot on March 30, 1973, and had their first child the same year. In their time together, the pair gave birth to three children, 2 daughters, and a son. Their first child Shawna Rene Blackstock was born in 1973, he was followed by Brandon Blackstock, born in 1976, and the pair had a daughter, Chassidy Celeste Blackstock, who was born in 1978.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Narvel-Blackstock-ex-wife-Elisa-Gayle-Ritter.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Divorce:</h2><p>While the pair stayed together for 15 years, things started changing gradually. Around the time Narvel’s stature as a talent manager and musician had grown and he had to travel a lot during his work. Elisa didn’t take long days of traveling well, considering how he was rarely spending time with their kids. Fed up with his ever-busy schedule, Elisa opted for a divorce. The pair separated after 15 years of togetherness on March 31, 1988.</p><p>While it is presumed that the pair divorced due to Narvel’s busy schedule, many suspected that Narvel had been cheating on Elisa. Given that Narvel was the steel guitarist for Reba McEntire’s band and also worked as her manager, many suspected that Narvel was cheating on Elisa as he later tied the knot with Reba McEntire. During the time, Narvel denied all claims of cheating and continued his rise to fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Narvel Blackstock:</h2><p>Narvel Blackstock is an American music manager and television producer. He was born on August 31, 1956, in Tarrant County, Texas. Blackstock is best known for his work as the manager of several country music stars, including Reba McEntire and Blake Shelton.</p><p>Blackstock began his career in the music industry as a steel guitar player. He later became a music manager and established his own management company, Starstruck Entertainment. Under his guidance, several country music stars, including Reba McEntire, Kelly Clarkson, and Blake Shelton, achieved great success in the music industry. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to his work as a music manager, Blackstock has produced several television shows and movies, including “Malibu Country” and “Reba,” “Video Gold II ” (2006), “Is There Life Out There?” (1994), “Forever Love” (1998), and “Secret of Giving” (1999).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life After Divorce & Moving On:</h2><p>Elisa Gayle Ritter did bury the hatchet and moved on swiftly from the divorce. Although she did not marry a famous person from the entertainment industry she indeed met a man for life. Elisa is together with her husband Daniel Gilbert for over thirty years. The feat is by no means small considering her first marriage to Narvel lasted less than fifteen years. Not long after the divorce, Elisa married Gilbert in August 1989, and the pair have been together ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Elisa-Gayle-Ritter-current-husband-Daniel-Gilbert.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship with Reba McEntire, look alike?</h2><p>Elisa Ritter and Reba McEntire are not biologically related. The only connection they have is their ex-husband Narvel Blackstock. Following his divorce from Elisa, Narvel married Reba McEntire in 1989 but the pair divorced in 2015. Since the split, Narvel has been dating Reba’s best friend, the real estate agent, Laura Putty Stroud. However, people are often confused by the appearances Elisa and Reba possess. Are they look alike? The answer is no Elisa and Reba share very different facial features and looks. By no means they are look-alikes and the following picture clearly illustrates so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Narvel-Blackstock-ex-wife-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=5.5><tr><td>Name</td><td>Elisa Gayle Ritter</td></tr><tr><td>Other Name</td><td>Elisa Gilbert</td></tr><tr><td>Birthdate</td><td>January 6, 1956</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birthplace</td><td>Tarrant County, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Husband</td><td>Narvel Blackstock&nbsp;(m. 1973–1988), Daniel Gilbert(m. 1989)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Brandon Blackstock,&nbsp;Chassidy Celeste Blackstock,&nbsp;Shawna Rene Blackstock</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac</td><td>Capricorn</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGicpaGjlnqordilnGaqmanBpr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-donna-jordan-michael-a-jordan-everything-to-know-about-michael-b-jordan-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Donna Jordan &amp;amp; Michael A.
