Furthermore, there are plenty of artists out there who will act nice for a collab, but then want to beef with you later on. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">When you are in the entertainment world</a>, finding true friends can be almost impossible. However, it seems as though <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Fif has found at least one lifelong</a> friend in <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Eminem</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In fact, 50 took to Instagram on Wednesday morning where he posted a photo of himself alongside Eminem. It was here that the legendary rapper delivered a short but sweet caption about the power of friendship. Throughout this caption, 50 Cent made it clear that when it comes to friendship, he would rather just have a few amazing friends, then a lot of bad ones.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-amp-eminem-are-a-powerful-duo>50 Cent & Eminem Are A Powerful Duo</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"My friends are important to me, I have came across so many suckers I value them," 50 Cent wrote. "I learned a lot about my self over the years. I don’t need a lot of friends, just a few good ones." This is certainly some good advice to follow. Not everyone is going to have your best interests at heart. However, if you can have just a few close friends who have your back, you are going to be a lot more fulfilled as a person.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about the duo of Eminem and 50 Cent, in the comments section down below.
