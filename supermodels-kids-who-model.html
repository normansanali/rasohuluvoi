After that, I couldn’t really hold her back.” Kaia has since walked in hundreds of fashion shows and graced the cover of Vogue, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looking exactly like her legendary mom</a>.</p><p>Having experienced model life firsthand, some of these moms, who are in the new Apple TV+ series <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Super Models</a> dishing about their glory days, admit that they tried to keep their kids from the spotlight at first, fearing the pressures would be too much. Both Elle Macpherson and Brooke Shields have spoken about trying to keep their kids out of the public eye before their interest in modeling began, but ultimately, they were too impressed with their kids’ ambition to protest. They knew it would be up to their kids to make a name for themselves.</p><p>“Even though we might carry the same last name,” Kate Moss’s daughter reflected in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">InStyle</a>, “we have to work hard to gain trust and respect in the industry.

Her modeling career over the years, however, has been quite impressive. In addition to becoming “the face” of major brands like Chanel, Mugler, and Versace, per <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Georgia also became the spokesperson for Hudson Jeans and Rimmel London.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Christy Turlington’s Daughter Grace Burns</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1472564750.jpg><p>Christy Turlington’s daughter Grace Burns has been slowly on the rise in the modeling world. Most recently, the 19-year-old had her <a href=#>runway debut</a> at the British Vogue X LuisaViaRoma show in Florence, Italy.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9681415929204><h2>Heidi Klum’s Daughter Leni Klum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1243118084.jpg><p>Heidi Klum’s daughter Leni Klum made her modeling debut at age 16 with a striking Vogue Germany cover posed alongside mom Heidi in December 2020. In 2021, she made her runway debut at Berlin Fashion Week and her bookings haven’t slowed down since.</p><p>While Heidi had hoped her daughter would start working at a slightly older age, she’s pragmatic: “She’s driving a car now….so I figured if you can do that, you can also model now if this is what you wish to do,” she told&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.828524319868><h2>Cindy Crawford’s Kids Presley Gerber & Kaia Gerber</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1422359678.jpg><p>Both Presley Gerber and Kaia Gerber, whom Crawford shares with husband Rande Gerber, are making a name for themselves in the modeling world.&nbsp;</p><p>At just 10 years old Kaia made her modeling debut as the face of Versace’s Young Versace line and has since walked hundreds of catwalks like her legendary mom — from Calvin Klein to Alexander McQueen, Chanel, and more. And son Presley made his first runway debut in 2017 at Moschino’s Los Angeles Resort show.</p><p>“When she [Kaia] was little, about seven years old, she would play dress-up in Mom’s clothes,” Crawford told <a href=#>Town and Country</a>. “I would do her hair and makeup and we would play photoshoot or runway show. I would be shooting the pictures, and I’d be like, ‘No, put your chin up,’ or ‘Hold your arm out like that.’ Probably, a little of it stuck.”</p><p>“As far as being a mother of two young people going into fashion, of course, I worry,” Crawford said. “But let’s be honest. My kids are blessed in that business because they aren’t coming in as unknowns. People know that I will come after them if they mess with my kids.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.9690721649485><h2>Pat Cleveland’s Daughter Anna Cleveland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1080532904.jpg><p>Pat Cleveland was known the world over for her runway walk and collaborations with top fashion brands in the 1970s. Her daughter, Anna Cleveland, whom she shares with her husband Paul Van Ravenstein, definitely inherited her mother’s striking looks and passion for the runway, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Anna once described how her introduction to the fashion world came directly from her mom. “I remember my first pair of shoes that my mom got me, and they were these pink, little plastic shoes. And I remember putting them on and that sound of, like, ‘Tic, tic, tic, tic’ – there was something about that sound. … It made me feel really good: empowered, confident somehow,” Anna told <a href=#>CNN</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.961038961039><h2>Jennifer Flavin’s Daughter Sistine Stallone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1132889814.jpg><p>Prior to becoming a business owner and Sylvester Stallone’s better half, Jennifer Flavin was a runway model. Stallone and Flavin share three daughters, and all seem to show an aptitude for courting the camera — especially Sistine Stallone. Sistine is already a bonafide model, having signed with IMG Models, walked in shows for Chanel and appeared on the cover of Elle Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the guidance Flavin has imparted to her daughter, Sistine told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in 2016, “She has taught me to show up on time and be willing to do what it takes to deliver the photographer’s vision; arrive a little bit early, stay a little bit later, and work as hard as you can in between.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.8937381404175><h2>Kimora Lee Simmons’ Daughters Aoki & Ming Lee Simmons</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1187034848.jpg><p>Kimora Lee Simmons’ daughters Aoki and Ming Lee Simmons have been on the runway with her mama since they were young girls, but their budding modeling career isn’t any less exciting.&nbsp;</p><p>“I grew up on the runway, walking with my mom and sister at the end of every Baby Phat show during fashion week in New York,” Ming told <a href=#>W Magazine</a> in 2017. “I’ve been in ads with my mom and sister since I was 2 years old. I’m only now realizing how uncommon that is and I’m deeply appreciative of those experiences.” Since starting her career, Ming has been in a number of fashion campaigns, including Forever 21, Skims and Good American.&nbsp;</p><p>Ming’s younger sister Aoki also has plans to take the modeling world by storm. “I’ll be in New York modeling, writing and working at my mom’s company,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> after graduating from Harvard earlier this year. “There are so many projects that I can’t wait to dive into.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4352517985612><h2>Brooke Shields’ Daughter Grier Hammond Henchy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1464876909.jpg><p>Brooke Shield’s youngest daughter Grier Hammond Henchy, whom she shares with her husband Chris Henchy, looks just like mom.&nbsp;</p><p>And while Henchy has begun to model, Shields would rather her daughters pursue other passions, “I think they need to really have as much of a conventional upbringing as you can in New York City, with kids their own age, and not be thrown into something with all the pressure,” the actress and model told <a href=#>The Post</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.4383468834688><h2>Kate Moss’ Daughter Lila Grace Moss-Hack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1247689234.jpg><p>As the daughter to one of the most famous supermodels in the world, &nbsp;Lila Grace landed her first modeling job as the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty campaign. After that, she modeled for Ermanno Scervino and was on the cover of the May issue of British Vogue.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>InStyle</a>, the teenager opened up about following in mom’s footsteps. “Before shooting my first campaign, she told me, ‘Listen and do what they tell you to do.’ It was intimidating,” Lila said.&nbsp;</p><p>“But I think the best lesson she has taught me is to ‘work hard, be polite to everyone I meet, and to always make sure you’re comfortable with whatever you’re doing.'”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Yolanda Foster’s Daughters Bella & Gigi Hadid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1395068383.jpg><p>Bella and Gigi Hadid may be two of the biggest supermodels in the world today, but mom Yolanda Foster was a supermodel before she’d ever had her daughters with ex-husband Mohamed Hadid.
