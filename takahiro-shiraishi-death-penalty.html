The serial killings involved him stalking suicidal victims online and sending them messages through social media, saying that he would help the victims die.</p><p>Shiraishi acted out his gruesome murder plots using a Twitter handle which loosely translates as “hangman.” It’s suspected that once he secured the victims’ trust, he invited them over to his apartment where he carried out the murders.</p><p>According to the indictment, Shiraishi strangled and dismembered eight women and one man during his killing spree between August to October 2017. He allegedly sexually assaulted all of his female victims. The ages of the victims ranged from 15 to 26 years old and they hailed from inside and outside of Tokyo.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-309732 alt="Takahiro Shiraishi Court Sketch" width=900 height=679 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/takahiro-shiraishi-court-sketch.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-309732 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Masato Yamashita/Jiji Press/AFP via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Sketch of Takahiro Shiraishi at the Tokyo District Court during his trial.</span></p><p>Police finally uncovered his online murder spree after they found the bodies of his victims stuffed into coolers in his apartment.</p><p>The discovery occured during a missing person investigation involving a 23-year-old woman who had posted on Twitter that she was looking for someone to kill herself with. Investigators found the bodies after a sting operation led them to Shiraishi’s home.</p><p>Presiding Judge Naokuni Yano described the crimes as “extremely vicious in crime history,” and spoke to the societal fears over social media that the so-called “Twitter murders” have raised.</p><p>But during the trial, the case was less clear cut. Since Shiraishi’s MO involved convincing his victims to let him help them die, his defense team argued that the victims had essentially consented to their deaths — no matter how gruesome they were — based on his messages with the victims.</p><p>In addition, they argued that the perpetrator was more appropriately guilty of homicide with consent and claimed that Shiraishi was possibly in a state of diminished mental capacity during the murders.</p><p>The prosecutors, who sought the death penalty for the murders, have argued that the victims couldn’t have consented based on Shiraishi’s own testimony that his victims resisted when they were being killed. His defense team, again, chalked it up to the victims’ “conditional reflexes.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-309731 alt="Police At Takahiro Shiraishis Apartment" width=900 height=592 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/police-at-takahiro-shiraishis-apartment.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-309731 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>STR/AFP via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>The bodies of his nine victims were found dismembered and stored in coolers at his apartment in Zama, Kanagawa Prefecture.</span></p><p>Shiraishi himself denied the defense argument in court, stating explicitly, “Not a single one of my victims consented.”</p><p>According to court documents, Shiraishi, who lives in Zama in Japan’s Kanagawa Prefecture, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blamed</a> a falling out with his family as the trigger to his crimes.</p><p>After the fight with his father, Shiraishi began preying on lonely women to seduce them for money. He learned his seduction tricks while working as a recruiter for an escort service in Kabukicho, one of Tokyo’s red-light districts.</p><p>He quickly found a rich source for potential victims on Twitter where he searched for suicidal victims. But his scheme morphed into murder, he said, when he thought one of the women he met would demand her money back. So he killed her.</p><p>“I had a hard time making up my mind to do it, but I had done illegal things on a daily basis as part of my work as a scout and had internalized the idea that ‘It’s only a problem if you get caught,'” Shiraishi told the court.</p><p>He also said that he would not be seeking to appeal his case if a death sentence was dispensed.</p><p>“If they hadn’t caught me, I would regret nothing,” he admitted.</p><p>Next, read about the disturbing case involving 17-year-old <a href=#>Michelle Carter</a>, who stood trial for urging her boyfriend to kill himself via text messages, and the tragic story of <a href=#>Evelyn McHale</a>, whose death was disturbingly dubbed “the most beautiful suicide.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1rcqan6Kqn2LAqbXRmqCsoJlisaat06FkqZ2elrm1xQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kamal-haasan-net-worth-211374.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kamal Haasan Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./isaiah-mustafa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Isaiah Mustafa Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
