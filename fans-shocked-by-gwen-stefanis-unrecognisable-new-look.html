Can't believe how different she looks now," said another, referring to one of her No Doubt looks of the late 90s.</p><p>"I'm a lifelong fan of Gwen's and I didn't recognise her. I'm so confused," wrote another.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Would never have known this was Gwen Stefani without the title!" said another.</p><p>Stefani's eternally ageless looks have been the subject of much conjecture over the years, but the star has never spoken publicly about having any cosmetic procedures. In a 2016 Carpool Karaoke appearance, host James Corden asked her about how exactly she seemed to be ageing in reverse – and she attributed it to her relationship with now-husband Blake Shelton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/LgCHoA8JvU9e_FbqO4UEi0hFKAI=/16x23/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/P35MMBABM7FQ7G7FNRXATYBRDQ.png"><p>"I kind of started falling in love. Then I wrote a whole record about that. That's what the 'face' lift is, I think!" she said.</p><p>It's not the first time the chameleonic Stefani's made headlines for a near-unrecognisable new look. Back in 2016, she shocked fans by appearing at the Billboard Awards with vastly different make-up - enough of a major departure for her that her longtime make-up artist later had to publicly defend the new look.</p><p>And last year, the star caused a stir with a wild new hairdo as she fronted up to an episode of The Voice: her usual blonde hair, plus black bangs and a black ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/0lIBBJC1ym_vGkprd2SP54YO1R8=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PBJAVHAMRJ26KQQYS7UVMPKM7E.png"><p>Stefani evolved into a style icon after her early days as the frontwoman of 90s ska-pop band No Doubt, going solo in 2004 and eventually launching her own fashion and make-up lines.</p><p>But fans eager to hear more music from the star, who hasn't released an album in five years, will be disappointed by her candid confession in a recent interview.</p><p>Revealing she wrote "30+ songs" for a new album during Covid quarantine, Stefani confessed she didn't feel passionate about any of the material, and instead decided to focus her energies on her marriage to Shetlon.</p><p>"I kind of put it on the back-burner, but I also feel like sometimes, I don't really have much to say or I don't know if I do – and so, I'm just going to wait and pray about it," she told Forbes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzorrSZqqhp5OgsqV5wbJkoK%2BVo3q0wMSfmKeho2LCr77EnKagppmorqO4xGalnq9dobywt46Kf4tqfXyPhpWjiY%2BHboh3nniSs4xriHlkenw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./five-mysteries-uncovered-by-google-earth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Five Mysteries Uncovered By Google Earth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dylan-mulvaney-weight-loss-dylan-mulvaney-before-and-after-surgery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dylan Mulvaney Weight Loss: Dylan Mulvaney Before And After Surgery</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
