And, to underline this is a brilliant bit of Oscar-related trivia that showcases just how iconic he was as Rocky.</p><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>The interesting Acadamey Award tidbit about Stallone is that he’s one of just six actors to be nominated for an Oscar twice for playing the same character in two separate films. The first nomination, for Best Actor, came in 1977 after he starred in the original Rocky (he also received a nomination for Best Screenplay, as he wrote the film himself). His second came for Best Supporting Actor in 2016, after he reprised the role of Balboa for the film Creed. Considering the runaway critical and commercial success of the franchise, is it any wonder Stallone keeps pumping them out?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sylvester Stallone in the ring on the set of "Rocky."

In it, he played the grouchy, traditionalist Father Fitzgibbon, who clashes with Crosby’s O’Malley throughout the film. The Academy changed the rules about nominations after Fitzgerald was put up for both main male acting awards, making sure that in the future, someone couldn’t receive dual nominations for the same role in the same year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TAurjVnqqtnaJiwLWty6Wmp51dnsBuu82eZKieXZ%2FCtMCMrKCxZZGYwbC%2B0marqGWRmLWqsdWeZJqmXZbAtbvUp5uippdivLSvwKtkmq%2BRp7FurcKhoJ6ulaKyr8CO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-true-blood-porn-parody-loo-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The True Blood Porn Parody Looks More Believable Than the Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sugarhill-ddot-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>SugarHill Ddot Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
