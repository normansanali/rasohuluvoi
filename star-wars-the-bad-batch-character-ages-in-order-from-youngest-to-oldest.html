Between obscure batch numbers and accelerated growth, it can be hard to determine which clones count as “older brothers” and which ones fall into “younger brother.” Throw in some genetically unmodified clones like Alpha and Omega and things get even more confusing.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Be forewarned that the creative masterminds behind Star Wars have yet to give any concrete evidence regarding birthdays for all our favorite clones, but with the context clues scattered throughout <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: The Bad Batch</a></strong> and elsewhere in the vast, vast canon, we have some clues as to the ages of our favorite clone heroes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Clone Force 99</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>The boys of the Batch didn’t make their appearance until the final season of The Clone Wars, and the reverence their fellow clones held for them gave the impression that Clone Force 99 had just recently started making a name for themselves. The Clone Wars movie showed us that after five years, clones appeared to be around the age of 12.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The Batchers were more personalized than their plethora of “Reg” brothers, with key genetic mutations manipulated and enhanced to give them special abilities. Due to their accelerated growth, most clones only lived to around 35 years old, so no matter what, The Bad Batch boys are still relatively young. It’s almost impossible to narrow down which brother was born first, so we had to look deeper and use their personalities to round out the list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tech</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tech-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Tech looks to be the youngest member of The Bad Batch. His youthful good looks and trim waistline give him the appearance of a 20-something goggle enthusiast. The eager way he tends to chatter about any trivial topic that sparks his interest only helps to emphasize his youthfulness. Our favorite super genius does sport an impressive receding hairline, but you have to sacrifice something to make space for all that brain.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>With his death at the end of season two, Tech will forever hold the position of youngest in our book.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wrecker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wrecker-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>We’re not sure if it’s all the brain damage or if he’s actually younger, but Wrecker seems a bit more youthful than his siblings. Sure, the massive scars may age him a bit, but the big softy has a joyfulness about him that smacks of vitality. Despite his bald head and visibly weathered appearance, the big man is clearly in touch with his inner child — he even claimed a stuffed tooka doll during his deployment.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>Wrecker seems like the cool, mid-thirties uncle that only comes around for the family BBQ and spends the whole time playing pretend with the hordes of younger cousins. No matter what his physical age, Wrecker’s juvenile, fun-loving disposition keeps him forever young.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Hunter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hunter-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>We’re not saying that age equates to experience here, but Hunter exudes calm older brother vibes. The perpetually grungy Sergeant is quick to communicate, listen to his teammates, and really embodies Dominic Toretto’s “I don’t have friends, I have family” sentiment. With his ’80’s hair inspirations, his practiced frown lines, and calm demeanor, Hunter seems older than most of his brethren. Top that off with his unwavering dedication to those he calls family and you have the perfect weathered leader.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Crosshair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Crosshair-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=884 data-injectable=true>With his bad attitude, sullen disposition, and cynical way of looking at the world, it’s incredibly easy to assume that Crosshair would qualify as the oldest Batcher. The man looks like he is carrying the weight of the world, and with that solid gray buzz cut, he easily looks twenty years older than the other members of the team. We’re assuming the unreasonable number of lines on his forehead come from squinting through his scope all day, or maybe from glaring bitterly at his teammates. All in all, his inability to reframe his worldview smacks of some serious boomer energy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Echo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Echo-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=644 data-current-count=944 data-injectable=true>Echo was a Reg long before he ever underwent the horrific abuse from the Empire that left him “more machine than man” and gained him a spot in the Bad Batch. An original member of Domino Squad, Echo was still wet-behind-the-ears when he met Commander Cody on Rishi Station. The encounter would propel Echo to a key tactical position in the 501st, Anakin Skywalker’s favorite legion. The hapless Echo was captured for presumably two years before being rescued by Rex and The Bad Batch, and if our assumption is that the other members of 99 are from a later group of clones, that places Echo as the firstborn clone brother in the Bad Batch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Omega</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Omega-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=775 data-current-count=1075 data-injectable=true>With the immense amount of backstory we have around Alpha, aka Boba Fett, we know much more about Omega’s creation than many of her siblings. The two genetically unmodified clones were the first of the Jango Fett replicas produced and were born sometime around 32 BBY, ten years before the start of the Clone Wars. As an unaltered clone, Omega grew at the normal rate of a human child, wandering the sterile white halls of Kaminoa as she trained under her mentor and boss, Nala Se. Omega admits to having watched the gestational period of her clone brethren back in season one, so she is without a doubt the oldest member of The Bad Batch. By the end of the Clone Wars, Omega would have been somewhere between 13-14, which puts her around 15 by the time season 2 ends.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Vice Admiral Rampart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rampart-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=704 data-current-count=1004 data-injectable=true>Though his tenure on the show was brief, we’d be remiss if we didn’t try to figure out how old Rampart was in the series. The Vice Admiral appears to be relatively young and less weathered than most of the Batchers. He really comes across as a fresh-faced and eager professional who is desperate for upper management to notice him. In true Empire fashion — we’re lookin’ at you, Ben Solo— Rampart has those deep-state connections that have pushed him to the top. The guy fraternizes with Grad Admiral Tarkin and Grand Viser Mas Amedda like his mom introduced them years ago. His enthusiasm, connections in high places, and lack of stress lines place him somewhere around his late 20s at most.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Phee Genoa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Phee-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>A normal adult Human, Phee easily fits in as one of the oldest Bad Batch mainstays. She looks to be in her 30s-40s and her charisma, swagger, and self-assured nature, combined with her — and this is key — financial stability, really solidifies her as an established professional. We’re not saying that early 20-somethings don’t have hustle, but Phee exudes that cougar energy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tarkin-Bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=868 data-injectable=true>There is no doubt about it, Tarkin has seen some things. Actor Peter Cushing was well into his ’60s when he played the iconic Star Wars baddie in A New Hope. By using Cushing’s age and the known time skip, we can place Tarkin’s age at around 42-45. It’s clearly been a rough couple of years for the Imperial, with his appearance drastically changing between his stint in the Clone Wars and his appearance in The Bad Batch. Either evil really takes its toll on a fella, or Tarkin needs to find some kind of skincare routine because our guy is looking rough.</p><h2 id=h-ciddarin data-injectable=false>Ciddarin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Cid-bad-batch.jpg><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=false>Cid, a Trandoshan, ages in roughly the same way as a human. Her gravelly voice, curvy physique, and affinity for pearls definitely mark the bar owner as nearing her golden years. She’s a temperamental old biddie, however, and prone to making rash decisions that damage her close&nbsp;relationships, much like a grandma when she gives unwanted feedback on your wardrobe. The crusty, backstabbing Trandoshan is easily the oldest member of the reoccurring cast, even if she never manages to earn our boy’s forgiveness and return to the series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMCrZLCZoqh6tbTEZpmanF2XrrWvx2aaoZmilrC1sdFmmKCdo2K2r3nOq5ueql2bv7C5jLKmrqaXmsC1edOoZKiklJrAtXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tracy-campoli.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tracy Campoli</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-grantham-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Grantham Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
