Dumbo was released to theaters on March 29, 2019. It nabbed the top spot at the USA box office and collected $45 million from 4,259 venues, falling short of expectations that anticipated a launch estimate of $50 million. Overseas, Dumbo got off to a better start, earning $71 million for a global launch weekend haul of $116 million. Walt Disney Studios shelled out $170 million to produce Dumbo, not including marketing and distribution fees.</p><p>Dumbo grossed $114.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $238.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $353 million, against a production budget of $170 million.
