The news came as a surprise to fans. However, the announcement of the divorce was an even bigger surprise to friends and family. This is because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McDermott and Spelling had reportedly been trying to work things out</a>.</p><p>"Their friends have seen their ups and downs through the years, but they really did seem to be in a good place in recent months," a source close to Spelling revealed.

Sure, they still had their disagreements and didn’t always see eye to eye, but the past six months things had felt good between them."</p><p>"They were definitely trying in the last few months though, and things felt way less toxic," another person close to Spelling explained. "They also made an effort to make holidays and milestones special, and were much more in tune with each other. It’s been a night-and-day difference from the last couple years."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was allegedly McDermott's excessive drinking and prescription drug abuse that ultimately ended the marriage</a>, with McDermott owning up to his missteps in November 2023.</p><p>"All Tori's ever done to this day is want me to be happy and healthy and I inflicted a lot of damage and pain on that woman," McDermott stated "It's going to be living the rest of my life making amends because I took something that was really beautiful and I just tore it down year after year, day after day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Dean McDermott Disappeared After That Deleted Divorce Announcement.

But when that time came, Spelling found someone to have fun with. That person is Cramer.</p><p>Cramer is an ad executive and CEO of the advertising agency Neuron Syndicate Inc.

In fact, he was linked to Lily Calo before news broke about Spelling and Cramer.

This was clear given that McDermott was linked to Lily Calo weeks before, if not longer, Spelling and Cramer debuted their romance.</p><p>McDermott and Calo were first spotted together as they held hands walking up to the Department of Social Services in October 2023; <a href=#>Spelling found her ex's new relationship to be "disrespectful" to the state of the relationship between herself and McDermott</a>. The two were then spotted later that month sharing a kiss as McDermott dropped Calo off at the airport.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dean-mcdermott-out-with-tori-spelling.jpg><p>With his new relationship seemingly going well, McDermott could not be happier that Spelling has someone new in her life as well. So happy, in fact, that McDermott had no problem discussing Spelling's PDA with her new beau as well as the type of person Spelling is in relationships.</p><p>"Tori as a person is a beautiful, kind and loving soul," McDermott explained to Daily Mail. "She's generous to a fault. She puts everybody before herself, even to the detriment of her physical and mental health."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that both Spelling and McDermott seem happy with the direction their love lives are going, any ideas of the two getting back together look to be squashed. However, given that the two were together for 17 years before going through the motions to divorce and that they have five children together, it is entirely possible they may try to rekindle their relationship.
