And though a lot of the discussions may center around his dating life (<a href=#>he is single</a>, as far as everyone can tell), there’s also been some claims about Fillion getting a lot of hate from people recently. Since then, fans have also come to the actor’s defense.</p><h2 id=why-do-people-hate-nathan-fillion>Why Do People Hate Nathan Fillion?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Stana-Katic-And-Nathan-Fillion.png><p>Over the years, people have cited a couple of circumstantial reasons for hating the actor. For some, the supposed hate stems from reports that later emerged regarding <a href=#>the alleged behind-the-scenes feud between Fillion and his Castle co-star, Stana Katic</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2016, fans of the longtime-running show were shocked to learn that ABC abruptly fired Katic, one of its main stars, from the series while opting to retain Fillion for a supposed ninth season. And while the show was eventually canceled shortly after the actress’ sacking, word would also spread that Katic and Fillion never really got along on set while working together.</p><p>Over the years, the two stars would remain mum on the subject but that hasn’t stopped sources from making public claims. One even said that Fillion and Katic wouldn’t speak to each other unless the cameras are rolling.</p><p>In addition, a source also claimed that Katic would often be so miserable working on the show that she would be in tears while in her dressing room. For some, this was enough to see Fillion in a negative light. Others also pointed out that the actor could have done something to stop Katic’s firing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Nathan Fillion Never Got Married</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, it is also believed that fans didn’t take too kindly on Fillion’s decision to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">defend Joss Whedon</a> after several accusations of toxic onset behavior and misconduct were brought against the director by stars of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the DC film Justice League.</p><p>While all this was unfolding, Fillion stated on the Inside of You podcast that he is willing to work with Whedon “again in a second.” The actor also went on to state that his working experience with the director was unlike the claims being made against him.</p><h2 id=what-is-nathan-fillion-really-like-in-person>What Is Nathan Fillion Really Like In Person?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Felicia-Day-Nathan-Fillion.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the most part, fans have nothing but kind words for Fillion after they got to meet the actor in person. On Reddit, one user said that the TV and film star “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truly seems like a down to earth guy</a> who just happens to be a [great] actor.”</p><p>Another Redditor also claimed that Fillion even readily gave a fan the case out of his own iPhone because he was worried about the fan’s phone safety. “The man is a saint in my book,” the user added.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Stana Katic And Nathan Fillion Got Married On Castle But Faced Couple's Therapy When The Cameras Weren't Rolling</a></span></p><p>Great fan experiences with Fillion are also not just limited to public forums. On the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actor’s Facebook page</a>, several have left messages after meeting him at various events. One fan even noted that Fillion complimented her eyes when she met the actor at Comic-Con in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan posted a ‘prom photo’ with the actor. Meanwhile, another fan also posted a photo of the actor with her son at Comic-Con to wish Fillion a happy birthday. Clearly, there’s a lot of love for the actor despite some controversies surrounding him over the years.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-nathan-fillion-after-castle>What Happened To Nathan Fillion After Castle?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nathan-fillion-at-the-premiere-of-the-suicide-squad.jpg><p>Fillion has certainly been up to so many things since Castle ended its run in 2016. For starters, he became a recurring guest star on the comedy hit Modern Family as weatherman Rainer Shine (who ends up <a href=#>dating Sarah Hyland’s Haley Dunphy</a>). Around the same time, Fillion also appeared on Netflix’s Santa Clarita Diet as realtor Gary West.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, the actor also worked on several animated projects for DC Comics, voicing the Green Lantern in films such as The Death of Superman, Reign of the Supermen, and The Death and Return of Superman. Fillion also later starred as The Detachable Kid or T.D.K. in James Gunn’s TheSuicide Squad.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Nathan Fillion's Cameo On 'The Big Bang Theory'</a></span></p><p>While all these have been going on, the actor has also been hard at work on his latest ABC series, The Rookie. The series stars the veteran actor as John Nolan, LAPD’s oldest rookie who keeps up with much younger rookies by using his determination, sense of humor, and life experience.</p><p>Aside from this, Fillion also recently made an appearance in the Netflix series The Recruit as a CIA director. The actor also delighted fans when joined the cast of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as villain Master Karja. Before this, Fillion also worked with Marvel briefly on the Hulu series M.O.D.O.K. where he voiced Simon Williams, a.k.a. Wonder Man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, fans of Fillion have a reason to celebrate as ABC recently renewed The Rookie for a third season. The series is said to be the studio’s number-one show among adults aged 18 to 49 after it was moved to Tuesday nights. The move has led to a 40 percent increase in total viewership and by the looks of it, The Rookie is not going anywhere.</p><p>That said, ABC hasn’t announced the future of the show beyond season six.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ec2aq6GZnmKzqrjLoqanZaKarq242GajoqOVYravec%2BeqaynnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shiloh-jolie-pitt-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shiloh Jolie Pitt Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./otto-padron-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Otto Padrn Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
