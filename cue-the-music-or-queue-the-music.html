They are both widely used, and to ‘cue the music’ is a&nbsp;<strong>phrase used when asking musicians to get ready</strong>&nbsp;to play.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Queue_and_Line></span>Queue and Line<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Queue-and-Line.png alt="Queue and Line" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Queue the music’ is a common phrase in the UK, but not so much in the US. But, it applies to a slightly different set of actions, as we shall see. It has different uses depending on the environment you are in.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, you wouldn’t say ‘Line the music’ instead of ‘cue the music.’ But, if you were shopping, you could say you were ‘lining up’ or ‘queuing up,’ and both would be acceptable and understood.</p><p>But, if you were setting up a playlist for a function, you could ask the DJ to form a queue of music. That is a queue or list of music that is to be played in advance of it being played.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=To_Cue_Or_Not_To_Queue></span>To Cue Or Not To Queue?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So, when do you correctly use both words? The word ‘cue’ usually refers to a requirement for immediate action. For an individual or a group of people to start something.&nbsp;</p><p>A queue is usually the creation of an ordered line that is not immediate but will be acted on at some point. Let’s look a bit closer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Cue></span>The Cue<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are plenty of&nbsp;<strong>uses for the word ‘cue’</strong>&nbsp;that have been adopted in various situations. And some have nothing to do with music or the theater. For example, a cue is a name given to the stick you use when playing Snooker, Billiards, or Pool.</p><p>But, in musical terms, the&nbsp;<strong>meaning of the word cue</strong>&nbsp;is a signal that will result in an action being undertaken. For example, when the conductor of an orchestra taps his lectern, this is a cue for the musicians to be ready to commence.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=In_The_Theater></span>In The Theater<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the theater, or for that matter, in film, a cue is also a reminder that something needs to happen that includes them. That could be a director giving actors a cue for an action to be performed.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, it could be actors giving each other cues in their narration using certain words. What we are saying is that the word cue demands an action that is often immediate.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Queue></span>The Queue<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The word is originally French, and one of its literal translations is tail. It is used sometimes in French to refer to a braid of hair, like a plait, hanging down the back. That gives it an indication of length, and it is often used in English to mean a line.</p><p>It can be used in a wide variety of situations. It could be forming a line – queue to buy something. Or, it could be joining an already existing queue/line to board a plane or pass through customs.</p><p>It could be ‘queuing’ a series of songs or videos that are to be played in a certain order. This is not random but by request. It is therefore very ordered.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Line_Doesnt_Always_Work_As_A_Word></span>Line Doesn’t Always Work As A Word<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Replacing the word ‘queue’ with ‘line’ doesn’t always work. And, there are occasions&nbsp;<strong>when the word ‘queue’ is used</strong>&nbsp;automatically. For example, you would say that you want to queue songs or videos to download or watch. It wouldn’t make grammatical sense to say you want to ‘line’ them.</p><p>Generally speaking, the&nbsp;<strong>meaning of the word queue</strong>&nbsp;is an ordered list to be carried out over some time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Use_Of_Up></span>The Use Of Up<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Use-Of-Up.png alt="The Use Of Up" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>You will sometimes see the use of the word ‘up’ with either word. This does change the action slightly. ‘Cue’ used on its own is a word that indicates something is going to commence immediately, as we have discussed.&nbsp;</p><p>But when used with up, as in ‘Cue Up,’ it means to get prepared to start on cue. Similarly, placing ‘up’ behind the word queue or line is telling you to get in order or get in line for something so that it is ready to happen.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=So_Is_it_%E2%80%98Cue_the_Music_or_%E2%80%98Queue_the_Music></span>So, Is it ‘Cue the Music’ or ‘Queue the Music’?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cue_The_Music></span>Cue The Music<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>If you are preparing or want others to prepare to commence a piece of music, then cue is the right term to use. This will also apply in films and the theater for an actor, the lights, or even the music to prepare to commence.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Queue_The_Music></span>Queue The Music<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This would be the right term to use if you are creating a list of songs to play at a party or function. The word queue does not imply an immediate commencement but a preparation. The word cue demands an almost immediate action to commence.</p><p>If you work in the theater, it can be a difficult time as there can be so much to do.
