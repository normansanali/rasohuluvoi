In particular, the subjects of her songs have responded with harsh words and, in some cases, songs that are supposed to answer Swift back.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Taylor Swift And Miley Cyrus Actually Friends?</a></span></p><p>John Mayer, whom Swift dated in 2009, definitely wasn’t feeling the song she wrote about him.

At the time they were dating, Swift was 19 and Mayer was 32.</p><p>It’s not clear <a href=#>why they broke up</a>, but the relationship between Swift and Mayer seems to have fizzled out in 2010.</p><h2 id=the-song-lsquo-dear-john-rsquo>The Song ‘Dear John’</h2><p>In 2010, Swift famously wrote the song ‘Dear John’ which is believed to be about her relationship with Mayer.
