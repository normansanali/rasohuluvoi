As mentioned in the teaser, Brad Pitt, a Hollywood superstar, will make a surprise cameo in the Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum film. Sandra Bullock explained to Entertainment Weekly how Pitt came to be a part of the film. It occurred as a result of an exchange and mutual contact with their hairdresser. Pitt agreed to feature in The Lost City after Bullock agreed to appear in the thriller Bullet Train.</p><p>Sandra Bullock claimed that Pitt worked for free for a day on the shoot when discussing what it was like to have Pitt on site. For the film Lost City, he only intended to shoot for three days. He was exhausted after finishing another shot. Even so, when Bullock urged him to shoot for free on the fourth day, he agreed. Bullock said that he bulked up for the three-day role as part of his devotion. She continued,</p><p>“You realize he’s a movie star and a brilliant actor for a reason: he works really hard. He brought an incredible work ethic to the table. Monsoon rains fell. It was quite hot. We were in the middle of the woods… He brings professionalism, and he is Brad Pitt because he is just absolutely wonderful.”</p><h2>How rich is Brad Pitt?</h2><p>Brad Pitt doesn’t require an introduction. He is a multi-award-winning film actor and producer with an estimated net worth of $300 million as of November 2023. He is one of the highest-paid actors, earning a minimum of $20 million for big motion film releases on a regular basis. Pitt’s first major role was in Thelma & Louise, for which he received just $6,000.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Brad-Pitt-2.jpg alt="Brad Pitt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Four years later, he was paid $4 million for his role in the popular film Se7en. His basic film compensation had risen to $17.5 million by the late 1990s, and he has subsequently earned $20 million for his parts. He did, however, reduce his compensation to $10 million to participate in Quentin Tarantino’s films Inglorious Basterds and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Brad-Pitt-3.jpg alt="Brad Pitt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Pitt also owns a number of real estate holdings valued at more than $100 million. His long-term permanent house in Los Angeles is a genuine complex that he has built together over the years via a series of transactions. In 2000, he paid $4 million for a seaside property in Santa Barbara, and in 2006, he spent $3.5 million on a historic mansion.&nbsp;Pitt and his then-partner Angelina Jolie bought $67 million buying a 1,200-acre vineyard in southern France in 2008. There is a main house with 35 rooms, many guest homes, and a recording studio on the site. Pitt paid $3.7 million for another property on the Spanish island of Majorca in 2015.&nbsp;Brad Pitt is unquestionably one of Hollywood’s wealthiest and most well-known actors.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Brad Pitt</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Brad Pitt Net worth</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmaaopaxbrzIratmppWperi70a2fZquRoa6zxYycmKudlad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaden-michael-parents-is-he-hispanic-everything-to-know-about-the-colin-in-black-white-actor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaden Michael Parents -Is He Hispanic?
