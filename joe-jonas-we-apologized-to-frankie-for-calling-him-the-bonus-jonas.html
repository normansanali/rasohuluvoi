Now he’s a bona fide viral star, with nearly 2 million TikTok followers. He also recently signed with United Talent Agency, whose clients include <a href=#><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Paul Rudd</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Angelia Jolie</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Joe-Jonas-We-Apologized-Frankie-Calling-Him-Bonus-Jonas-003.jpg><p>“This experience on TikTok is so different because I’m being so authentically myself and not caring and just doing what I can,” Frankie told Bustle of his recent social media fame. “I was just making jokes, thinking no one was hearing them. And then people heard them and liked them. I thought, ‘I’m going to continue to do this,’ because I’ve never had my thing really. This feels like so much of my thing. It feels so empowering to have a thing.”</p><p>Joe, who last July welcomed daughter <a href=#>Willa</a> with his wife, <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>, added that Frankie has spent a lot of time working on himself out of the spotlight, which helped him learn how to shine in his own right. “He’s done a lot of healing behind the scenes, and this is his way of bringing you into his own universe,” he explained. “He has a lot of fun with it. The guy is the social media star we honestly need.”</p><p>In a TikTok he shared last month, <a href=#>Frankie revealed</a> that he previously considered suicide while struggling with a drug and alcohol addiction. “I couldn’t be more grateful for the fact that I’m alive today because my world has changed so beautifully and so astronomically, and I am not that person anymore,” he said. “I couldn’t be more grateful that I’m alive and happy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the <a href=#>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Vit7C6wKxksJ1dlr2wuM6goLOdlGLBsHnFq5ino5maeqe70WaamqScnruoeceipGasmJp6o7vNrqpmop%2BjrrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julien-baker-bio-age-career-net-worth-family-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julien Baker Bio, Age, Career, Net Worth, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jim-toth-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Toth Net Worth, Wife, Children, Parents, Age, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
