On a season that includes new coach Camila Cabello, that’s an even nicer slot to occupy as the broadcast network’s splashy new drama.</p><p>Mondays in the fall will begin with the two-hour episode of “The Voice” at 8, followed by “Quantum Leap” at 10.</p><p>On Tuesdays, “The Voice” will kickoff the night with its one-hour edition at 8 p.m., leading into “La Brea” at 9. With the end of “This Is Us” just two episodes away, NBC had to hand the slot over to another drama for the fall and made the logical choice with breakout hit “La Brea,” which did well in the spot last fall when the final season of “This Is Us” was delayed to midseason due to the pandemic. Tuesdays will close with “New Amsterdam” at 10.</p><p><strong>CLICK HERE to follow Variety’s coverage of Upfronts 2022</strong></p><p>Dick Wolf is still the owner of NBC’s Wednesdays and Thursdays, which are made up of the “One Chicago” block of “Chicago Med,” “Chicago Fire” and “Chicago P.D.,” and “Law & Order,” “Law & Order: SVU” and “Law & Order: Organized Crime” respectively.</p><p>Fridays will initially see the return of Peyton Manning’s competition series “Capital One College Bowl” at 8. Starting in November, that hour will be the back-to-back comedy block of George Lopez’s freshman sitcom “Lopez vs. Lopez” and a new season of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s “Young Rock.” Variety is told the decision to put the comedies on Friday rather than another night of the week largely came down to the fact that NBC had no comedies on its schedule last fall, and wanted to change that this year, but had no other night free. The network sees this pairing of family-centric sitcoms a good fit for Fridays.</p><p>The weekend primetime lineup is the same, with “Sunday Night Football” returning to its fall slot anchoring the end of the week.</p><p>At midseason, NBC will debut its “Night Court” sequel series, featuring John Larroquette reprising his role as D.A. Dan Fielding from the beloved legal sitcom and starring Melissa Rauch as Judge Abby Stone. Returning shows this winter will include the 10th season of “The Blacklist,” as well as second seasons of comedies “American Auto” and “Grand Crew,” and competition series “That’s My Jam” and “The Wall.”</p><p>During the holidays, NBC will air new Dolly Parton TV movie “Dolly Parton’s Mountain Magic Christmas,” and bring back specials&nbsp; “Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party,” “Christmas in Rockefeller Center,” “The National Dog Show” and “Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.”</p><p>New entrants for the network’s unscripted lineup during the 2022-2023 season are the Wolf’s docuseries “LA Fire and Rescue,” which follows the real-life heroes of the Los Angeles County Fire Department; “The Wheel,” hosted by comedian Michael McIntyre and based on a smash hit UK format, consisting of contestants aiming to win big with the help of celebrity guests playing on a giant spinning wheel; and Dutch format “Million Dollar Island,” which will feature 100 contestants who attempt to forge friendships and build alliances as they plot to stay on a remote desert island for up to 50 days and compete to win their share of the ultimate $1 million prize.</p><p>Per NBC, the network has picked up these projects to pilot, but no decisions have been made on series orders: “Blank Slate,” “Found,” “Irrational,” “Unbroken” and an untitled drama from Mike Daniels. If these pilots get the series greenlight, they could launch later in the 2022-23 or be rolled over for the 2023-24 lineup.</p><p>“While leaning into our strong, stable schedule in the fall, we’re also rethinking legacy launch timing to give our shows the best chance for success,” said Frances Berwick, chairman of entertainment networks at NBCUniversal Television and Streaming. “With the huge reach that our affiliate partner stations provide, coupled with exclusive next-day availability on Peacock, our NBC shows will truly be accessible to audiences in any way that they want to watch.”</p><p>“We’re continuing to invest in content for NBC that not only has the huge broad appeal that defines the platform, but also the ability to continue to find fans across our platforms following its broadcast debut; a strategy we’ve already seen a lot of success with this season,” added Susan Rovner, chairman of entertainment content. “We’re very excited by the new additions to our lineup, which we believe will super-serve our linear audience. In addition, we will continue to develop and order pilots, all of which will help strengthen a robust year-round season.”</p><p>See the NBC Fall 2022 schedule below, with new shows denoted in all caps.</p><p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p><p>8-10 P.M. — The Voice</p><p>10-11 P.M. — QUANTUM LEAP</p><p><strong>TUESDAY</strong></p><p>8-9 P.M. — The Voice</p><p>9-10 P.M. — La Brea</p><p>10-11 P.M. — New Amsterdam</p><p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p><p>8-9 P.M. — Chicago Med</p><p>9-10 P.M. — Chicago Fire</p><p>10-11 P.M. — Chicago P.D.</p><p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p><p>8-9 P.M. — Law & Order</p><p>9-10 P.M. — Law & Order: SVU</p><p>10-11 P.M. — Law & Order: Organized Crime</p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><p>8-9 P.M. – Capital One College Bowl</p><p>8-8:30 P.M. – LOPEZ VS.
