The four people were inside the vehicle that hit a tree and caught fire. KCRA 3 has learned the vehicle is a Mercedes CLS registered out of Roseville.</p><p>David Martinez, a spokesperson for the CHP Auburn division, said the car was speeding well above the posted speed limit on East Roseville Parkway. According to a witness, the car then veered out of the lane onto the shoulder, when it collided with a tree near Brackenbury Way.</p><p>Several people heard the crash, including Neil Roszkowski who lives nearby.</p><p>“It wasn’t a normal sound, just a very, very loud thud,” he said.</p><p>When he ran to the intersection, he said the car was engulfed in flames.</p><p>“The flames were probably 25-35 feet high,” Roszkowski said. “I’ve never seen anything like it in my entire life.”</p><p>Trevor Santa Cruz was also near the intersection when he heard a big boom. He also ran to help. He said one man was already there using a fire extinguisher.</p><p>“I ran to the gym to get a fire extinguisher that still didn’t help,” he said.</p><p>Santa Cruz said they tried to open the doors but the flames were too intense.</p><p>“We were banging on the back of the trunk to see if anyone was moving in there. No one was moving, nothing,” he said.</p><p>He also said looking at the scene in daylight, he realizes there was nothing they could have done to save the men.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
