John Madden</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Many people, especially NFL fans, know that John Madden’s preferred mode of transportation is his bus. To avoid flying to play games, he would go for the bus in order to escape his fears.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, some years after the tragic California Polytechnic State University football team’s plane crash incident, his son Joseph Madden disclosed in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Business Journals</a>&nbsp;in the 1990s that his father’s avoidance of airplanes wasn’t due to fear of flying but somewhat claustrophobic.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This is one of the reasons why Madden initially established Goal Line Productions – a video production service in Pleasanton, California – to avoid having to fly to Los Angeles or New York for studio work.</span></p><h2><span id=2_Cortland_Finnegan>2.
