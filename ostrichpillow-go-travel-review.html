After refusing to schlepp a travel pillow with me and then complaining about my neck for almost my whole life, I decided enough was enough and brought the Ostrichpillow with me on my flights to and from JFK to Aruba, Curaçao and then back.</p><p><strong>Transport and packing: </strong>I was originally against using a travel pillow because I didn’t want one more thing taking up space in my bag or in my hands — when I travel, they are already full with my passport and phone in one hand and a Starbucks in the other. While the pillow does not deflate or pack flat, it does come with a handy Velcro closure that I looped around my suitcase handle for a hands-free experience.</p><p><strong>Neck support: </strong>Obviously, the main purpose of a travel pillow is to support your neck when trying to sleep on a plane or in a car. I did find that I needed to adjust the pillow a few times to find my perfect position, as the Velcro can be finicky if you have a larger neck. However, once I found a comfy position, I was able to fall asleep perfectly, and woke with no discomfort in my neck or shoulders.</p><p><strong>Other uses: </strong>Because I also have a bad back and herniated discs (I know, too young for this!) I decided to undo the pillow and place it behind my back for some lumbar support. Due to the memory foam and the way the pillow wraps around the body, I actually loved this use even more than on my neck, and was able to recline while also supporting my lumbar.</p><p><strong>Washing and storage: </strong>After my return, I did a mountain load of laundry right away. All I had to do to wash my pillow was unzip the cover and toss it in the wash. I usually do all my laundry on cold to preserve the colors, so this worked just fine. To store, I kept the circular box that the pillow came in and was able to roll it up and put it back, good as new for my next trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/pillow-split.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Super soft and holds the weight of your neck well</li><li>Velcro closure for adjustable size and ability to attach to your luggage</li><li>Can be used for lumbar and back support as well</li><li>Washable</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Can not be packed flat</li><li>May not be suitable for those with large necks</li></ul><p class=has-text-align-center>For more content, check out the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post Shopping</a> section.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ5Gnwaqvy55mqKukp7aktM%2Bio6Wnp2K0sHnTq5ivnZxiv6bCyJ6uaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shaunie-oneal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shaunie ONeal - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, Single</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-ponton-height-how-tall-is-olivia-ponton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Ponton Height: How Tall Is Olivia Ponton?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
