A <a href=#>physical confrontation</a> ensued between Edwards and <strong>Travis Scott </strong>after the rapper insulted <strong>Tyga</strong>, a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>According to an eyewitness, the incident began when Scott, 33, and Tyga, 34, were on stage at an event hosted by nightclub tycoon <b>Richie Akiva</b>. The onlooker told&nbsp;<i>Us</i> that Akiva gave Tyga a shoutout but Scott “grabbed the mic” out of Akiva’s hand to stop it, which led to Edwards intervening.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“AE started talking back to Travis. There was a big group of all their friends on stage as well. Travis walked off the stage and came back with [music producer] <b>Southside</b>, who started yelling at AE,” the witness claimed. “Travis tried to push AE off the stage and then all three were shoving each other. AE got a hold of Travis and threw him off the stage.”</span></p><p>A second source explained to Us that Edwards tried&nbsp;<span class=s1>to tell Scott that Akiva was “just showing love” to Tyga. While Scott initially stormed off stage, he later returned to confront Edwards with Southside and they became “erratic.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“AE was trying to calm down Southside and he wasn’t calming down and Southside was getting in his face,” the insider claimed. “They got into a shoving match and a fistfight and Travis came to defend his friend Southside and pushed AE. And when he got his bearings he defended himself.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When TMZ asked about the altercation, Edwards replied, “It’s all good,” and added, “I don’t want to fight. I don’t want to initiate that s–t.” At the same time, “I’m gonna protect myself and my people.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for what Cher thought of his involvement, he quoted this line from Future song’s “GTA”: “Whatever I’m with, my b—h with it too.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He then edited his comment by calling Cher “my woman.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Edwards, Cher and their 40-year age gap first <a href=#><span class=s2>made headlines</span></a> in November 2022 when they were spotted holding hands in Los Angeles. Engagement rumors soon swirled around the pair, especially after Cher shared a photo of a diamond ring that Edwards had given her over the holidays.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“THERE R NO WORDS, ALEXANDER, A.E,” the “Believe” singer&nbsp;</span><span class=s1><a href=#><span class=s2>tweeted in December 2022</span></a>, showing off her sparkler. “Woke up a min ago, & 1st thing … B4 I opened my eyes, I thought, ‘I need 2 run to Mom’s & show her my ring. She loves Diamonds.’ Before I realized it, I had a little tear, but I’m sure this is natural. Bet Mom’s ears were burning last nite. We were telling stories about her, WHAT A WOMAN.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Cher, who wished <a href=#><span class=s2>late mother Georgia Holt</span></a> could have seen Edwards’ gift, subsequently revealed that it was not an engagement ring. About five months later, in May 2023, <i>Us</i> confirmed that Cher and Edwards had<a href=#><span class=s2> ended their relationship</span></a> but remained on good terms.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>But last September, the duo were back on, <a href=#><span class=s2>jointly stepping out at Balmain’s Paris Fashion Week</span></a> presentation.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Cher and AE have been back together for a while now and they’re closer than ever,” a source <a href=#><span class=s2>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i></span></a>. “All their friends think they are adorable together and they have amazing chemistry.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since reuniting, Cher and Edwards have</span><span class=s1> <span class=s2>also spent time </span><a href=#>in the studio</a>.“AE and Cher have been working on music together, and AE even helped produce her latest Christmas album,” the insider told <i>Us</i>. “Everybody knows Cher is a music legend, but AE’s been trying to introduce her to a new sound with a little bit of New Age influence.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Cher told <a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s2>Extra</span></a> in October 2023 that Edwards was the individual who encouraged her to make <a href=#><span class=s2>her first holiday album</span></a>, succinctly titled <i>Christmas</i>. “It’s a very strange Christmas album,” she said of the LP. “All the tracks are their own little islands. Nothing seems to go together, but when you hear it, it works.”</span></p><p>While their age difference doesn’t seem to faze them, Cher’s older cultural references tend to fly over Edwards’ head.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Sometimes I’m talking to him and he has no idea who I’m talking about,” <span class=s2>Cher quipped to Extra</span>. “The other day, I said, ‘Do you know who, I don’t know, <strong>Clark Gable</strong> [is]?’ Somebody [else] said, ‘Yes, of course,’ but most of my references … He’ll look at me and go, ‘I wasn’t born yet.’”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJWnwG6uzrKdq6GVo7FurcRmnJ2vkaextHnSmrCsZaSdsrq%2BxGaYZqCRpb26ecWapKKkqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-boykin-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher Boykin Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-best-songs-produced-influenced-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 Songs That Wouldnt Exist Without SOPHIE</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
