From there, her career has seen only an upward growth, often making her personal life subject to scrutiny. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in March 2020, Palmer said she prefers to date someone not from the "same career." "I've always had the same philosophy when it comes to dating. Not that I wouldn't give someone a try. But trying to keep my private life outside of my work life, to me, it's easiest when you don't date someone with the same career," said the 'Hustlers' actress. However, her romantic partners include some high-profile men.</p><h2 class=split>2009: Earl 'Ben J' Benjamin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/680fbb44-c219-4dd4-b086-67154024fbb5.jpg><p>In 2009, Palmer was reportedly in a relationship with rapper Earl Benjamin, better known by his stage name Ben J. He was part of the hip-hop duo New Boyz. Both were in their late teens when they started dating.

The couple welcomed their child Leodis "Leo" Jackson in 2023. They seemed to have a happy, romantic life, but things seem to have changed lately. In July, Jackson posted on X criticizing one of Palmer's outfits during an Usher performance. They parted ways in October. And on November 9, she filed a restraining order against Jackson, which was immediately granted. Palmer also claimed that Jackson physically and emotionally abused her during the two-year relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoo5Wgsm68wKWknqqjYrGiwMinnmagmajBsL7YZpicrKKawLR5x5qqZpyRqbKledKerZ6qkaF6rsHSopqimZ6oerDCxKtkraCVYsamrdGs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelsey-grammer-age-height-weight-parents-wife-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelsey Grammer Age, Height, Weight, Parents, Wife, Children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hiroshi-mikitanis-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hiroshi Mikitanis Net Worth : Books &amp;amp; Controversy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
