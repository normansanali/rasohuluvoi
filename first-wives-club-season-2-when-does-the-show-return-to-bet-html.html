Filming is complete, and viewers can tune in on July 15 for more of the half-hour scripted show.

Meanwhile, Ari struggles with trying to balance working in Los Angeles temporarily and her long-distance relationship with David as he’s busy fulfilling his first term as State Senator. After starting her own record label, Hazel attempts to sign her first artist while returning from her world tour with a sexy plus one. At Ari’s request, Hazel and Bree welcome a new friend, Jayla, into their clique.

Her season 1 arc ended with plans to start an independent record label. Ari and David tried to regain footing in their marriage, but their career ambitions will continue to be tested as they head into season 2. Further, fans want to know if she’ll link up with her old friend again.</p><p id=par-6_54>Bree and Gary broke up, made up, and broke up again, but Bree’s job demands still haven’t changed. She had a nice time being single while it lasted — even though Hazel was a terrible house guest. But between Gary, work, and that one-night stand with Jesus, things should get interesting in season 2.</p><h2 id=h-season-2-welcomes-a-slew-of-new-characters>Season 2 welcomes a slew of new characters</h2><p id=par-7_34>In addition to a fourth member joining their friend group, Bree, Ari, and Hazel will bring some other new faces into the fold.
