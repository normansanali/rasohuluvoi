club.</p><p>Last week, the University of Miami women’s basketball program was <a href=#>hit with sanctions over the recruitment of Haley and Hanna Cavinder</a>, twins and TikTok stars who transferred from Fresno State, where they were All-Mountain West players.</p><p>At the heart of the matter, the Cavinder twins had dinner at the home of Miami booster John Ruiz, the billionaire founder of MSP Recovery and its subsidiary LifeWallet.</p><p>Ruiz tweeted about said dinner.</p><p>He has been perhaps the most famously brash booster in the country, helping, for example, to lure Nijel Pack, a former Kansas basketball player who was a four-star recruit out of high school, to Miami.</p><p>Pack <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> signed a two-year, $800,000 deal to promote LifeWallet plus Ruiz’s boat company, Cigarette Racing.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>7</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><p>In all, Ruiz has pledged to spend at least $10 million on NIL deals, and it’s presumable that the NCAA sanctions against Miami have as much to do with a warning shot over his lavish influence as any direct violation of the rules.</p><p>These are the first sanctions the NCAA has handed out.</p><p>The college sports governing body claimed the dinner comprised “impermissible contact” and a recruiting “inducement.”</p><p>You can freely write a contract for nearly a million dollars — or, in some instances much higher, as Florida notoriously <a href=#>had a $13 million NIL deal with quarterback Jaden Rashada fall through</a> just last month — but how dare you impermissibly induce athletes to your alma mater with a chef-cooked dinner.</p><p>Being savvy in the ways of social media, the Cavinder twins <a href=#>turned the saga into a TikTok video mocking the NCAA</a>.</p><p>Katie Meier, Miami’s women’s basketball coach, served a three-game suspension after it was discovered that she facilitated a meeting between the booster and social media stars.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image

involved in the NIL process — as if anyone believes those who preside over the highest levels of collegiate sports have nothing to do with six- or seven-figure wealth being transferred to star players.</p><p>The Hurricanes’ women’s hoops program was also fined $5,000 plus 1 percent of its budget — in other words, ashtray money for someone like Ruiz or another booster to reimburse through other channels.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">John Ruiz, billionaire Miami booster. <span class=credit>Instagram / John Ruiz</span></figure><p>The whole charade feels like an invisible fence that shocks dogs when they roam a few inches too far.</p><p>Ruiz has been so overt in his sponsorship of Miami athletes that the NCAA buzzed the program and hit them with a level of sanctions that will hardly serve as a strong deterrent for anyone else.</p><p>What’s the point?</p><p>And why did the NCAA make something as insignificant as a dinner its hill to die on?</p><p class=postsid
