He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm—and also because you never knew what he might say next," began Harry's message. "He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the Monarch, a decorated serviceman, a Prince and a Duke. But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry continued, describing his grandfather as "a rock" for his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and imagining how Philip would react to the public support following his passing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He has been a rock for Her Majesty The Queen with unparalleled devotion, by her side for 73 years of marriage, and while I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'" added Harry. "So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself. You will be sorely missed, but always remembered—by the nation and the world. Meghan, Archie, and I (as well as your future great-granddaughter) will always hold a special place for you in our hearts."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Concluding the message, Harry wrote, "Per Mare, Per Terram," a Latin term used by the British Marines that means, "By Sea, By Land."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">BAZAAR.com can confirm that Harry has already <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36088840/prince-harry-back-in-the-uk-two-days-after-prince-philips-death/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="arrived in the United Kingdom" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">arrived in the United Kingdom</a> ahead of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36077308/prince-philip-death-queen-funeral-plans/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="this Saturday's funeral services" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">this Saturday's funeral services</a> for the Duke of Edinburgh.
