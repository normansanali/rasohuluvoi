Tell All questioned why Liz Woods even wanted to be with him.</p><p>Big Ed belittled and gaslit her on stage, making Liz cry and infuriating the rest of the cast.</p><p>But that’s all behind him now as Big Ed says he’s learned how to be a better boyfriend, and all credit goes to Liz, who he says taught him how to treat her right.</p><p>Time will tell if that’s truly the case or not.</p><p>Especially since Big Ed and Liz are up for another 90 Day Fiance spinoff when viewers get to see their often toxic relationship play out once again on 90 Day: The Last Resort.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-big-ed-brown-explains-how-liz-woods-is-helping-him-learn-to-be-better>Big Ed Brown explains how Liz Woods is helping him learn to be better</h2><p>In the time between shows, Big Ed seems to have been working on himself quite a bit. And with Liz Woods’ help, he’s becoming a much softer, sweeter version of himself.</p><p>Hopefully, all this effort will pay off for Liz, who has put up with some seriously terrible treatment from Ed over the years.</p><p>But at least for now, Ed says he’s changed a lot, and now, he’s opening up about it.</p><p>“I haven’t changed one thing about Liz I admire,” he explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p>“She’s never broken up with me. And she’s never given up on me and I came out of, like, a 29-year, you know, not dating anybody. I didn’t really know how to be a boyfriend and I went and started to get therapy, and the therapist mentioned 15 co-dependencies. I think I had 14 of them. But Liz really kind of, in a way trained me on how to, you know, become a boyfriend.”</p><p>Big Ed went on to explain that the biggest issue that he had to fix was within himself. “I’m realizing that in life, if you’re not&nbsp;happy within yourself&nbsp;— which I haven’t been for a while — you can’t make the other person happy,” he explained.</p><p>Now, Big Ed is doing thoughtful things for Liz, like making her coffee, rubbing her feet, and even drawing her a bath after a long day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-big-ed-and-liz-woods-on-90-day-the-last-resort>Big Ed and Liz Woods on 90 Day: The Last Resort</h2><p>90 Day Fiance fans will get to see if Big Ed has really changed or if it’s all for show when the latest 90 Day Fiance spinoff kicks off this week.</p><p>Big Ed and Liz are one of five couples headed to a Florida resort for 90 Day: The Last Resort, where they will have a chance to work out their relationships and try to stay together with the help of therapy and each other.</p><p>It all starts on Monday, August 14, with an episode titled The Last Chance and is already proving to be quite explosive as spoilers for the upcoming spinoff claim that <a href=#>Jovi threatens to punch Big Ed</a> at some point.</p><p>It’s no secret that Jovi is not a fan of Liz’s man after the Tell All drama we saw much earlier this year, so putting them back together at the same resort <a href=#>along with Angela Deem</a> should prove to be an interesting watch.</p><p>90 Day: The Last Resort airs on Mondays at 9/8c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5KetG6xw2aZq6eno3q0rdisZKWhqmLEsLvDrGStqpGeu6awjKGgpmWkpHqjsYyaZJudpKmys3nBqLCfqpmau6V5wKGcmpxdpLNuhY9mm5qxXam1pnnLmqqtZaKawLC%2B02g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-morley-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-baby-movies-tv-series-the-100-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Morley Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Baby, Movies, TV Series, The 100, and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-ombre-nails-7488885.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Your Ultimate Guide on How to Do Summer Ombr Nails</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./asbjorn-krogh-nissen.html>Asbjrn Krogh Nissen Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./craig-federighi-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-salary-apple-wife-email-house-steve-jobs-and-family.html>Craig Federighi Bio, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary, Apple, Wife, Email, House, Steve Jobs and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./er-ejercito-net-worth-143173.html>ER Ejercito Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./howard-baskin.html>Howard Baskin Wiki, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Net Worth, Parents, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-dark-nail-polish-british-fashion-awards-royal-protocol.html>Meghan Markle Wears Dark Nail Polish</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog.
