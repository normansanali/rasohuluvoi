It had previously sailed to several other European countries without incident.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-330814 alt="Ark Museum Being Towed" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ark-museum-being-towed.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-330814 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Verhalen Ark/The Ark Museum</span><span class=caption-body>The Ark Museum being towed in the moonlight.</span></p><p>But now, British officials have cited further concerns about its safety, including issues with its fire equipment, life jackets, and lifeboats, and refuse to let it leave. The owner, Dutch television producer Aad Peters, has been <a href=# rel=noopener>fined</a> over $65,000 so far. And the port is fining him $700 per day that the ship remains.</p><p>However, Peters argues that the ship, which is built on a barge, has no engine, and must be towed wherever it goes, is a “non certified floating object” and is not required to “comply with international regulation.” He insists he is ready to tow it back to the Netherlands if British authorities would just let him.</p><p>As Peters explains it, there was never any need to register the vessel in its home country of the Netherlands. It is, after all, not an actual ship. But the lack of registration has caused Peters problems in the U.K., which is notably more strict with maritime regulations than the Netherlands.</p><p>If the ship had been registered in the Netherlands, authorities could grant it a one-time exemption to sail home. But because it is unclassified in its home country, the U.K. has effectively deemed it a commercial vessel, forcing it to abide by its regulations. This stalemate has left British and Dutch authorities frustrated.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-331011 alt="Adam And Eve In Noahs Ark" width=900 height=549 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/adam-and-eve-in-noahs-ark.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-331011 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Verhalen Ark/The Ark Museum</span><span class=caption-body>The 230-foot vessel even includes figurines of Adam and Eve.</span></p><p>“We do have concerns about this vessel and we cannot rely on the grace of God that it can be safely towed to Holland,” the Maritime and Coastguard Agency of Britain <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>.</p><p>As it stands, a conglomerate of agencies has since become entangled in this bureaucratic fiasco. From Britain’s Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate to the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Dutch Water Management department — all hands are on deck.</p><p>“We are aware of the situation and are in discussions with relevant agencies in the U.K. and the Netherlands,” Britain’s Department for Transport explained. “Safety remains the top priority.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-330812 alt="Tree Of Life In Noah's Ark" width=600 height=901 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tree-of-life-in-noahs-ark-museum.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-330812 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Verhalen Ark/The Ark Museum</span><span class=caption-body>A representation of the tree of life inside the embattled museum.</span></p><p>Peters bought the vessel in 2010 for $3.7 million to create a “talking point” for people of all backgrounds. It is one of two replicas built by Dutch carpenter Johan Huibers in 1960. The process took him seven years, following Biblical descriptions of the mythical ship exactly.</p><p>The Dutch producer initially even carried actual animals on board but explained that they “caused too many problems” and replaced the live creatures with wooden figurines.</p><p>The last time the ark was in the news was in 2015 — when it ran directly into a patrol boat of the Norwegian Coast Guard. The collision ruptured the hull, but no one was injured.</p><p>As for structural integrity at sea, Peters confessed after that trip that the ark can’t handle waves taller than six feet.</p><p>When asked if it could survive a flood like the one referenced in the Bible, Peters <a href=# rel=noopener>replied</a>, “Sadly, no. I don’t like to use the word ‘miracle,’ but it is a miracle that we got to Norway.”</p><p>After reading about the Ark Museum being detained by British authorities, learn about <a href=#>the 21 strangest museums in the world</a>.
