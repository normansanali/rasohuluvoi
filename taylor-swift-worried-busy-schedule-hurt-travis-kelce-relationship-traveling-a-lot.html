And tha’t snot just because of how difficult it can be traveling to each game given her schedule. Taylor is also worried about being a distraction, given the media attention her appearances bring.</p><p>“Taylor doesn’t want to be a distraction to Travis,” they revealed. “She knows it’s not easy when she shows up to his games. It’s a spectacle. She wants to support him and strike a balance while, at the same time, not be distracting to the team.”</p><p>While busy schedules and media attention may become an issue in the future, there’s no denying Taylor seems committed to making things work in the interim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lp6S%2Fs7XEnWSbraOuerSvx56brqSVYrW2vtNmq6uZpp7AbrfEpZqeZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1vsCvnKWhnpx6onnLqKto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./youre-next-posters-temptation-big-wedding-peeples-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Creepiest Movie Ad Campaign of the Summer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./timurlengia-euotica.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>See Timurlengia Euotica, The T.
